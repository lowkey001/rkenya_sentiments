1bptdip,Kenya,1711625736.0,"Si I decide to call my backup mwenye tulikuwa naye the yesterday night. He takes around 5 minutes to arrive. It is the first time I am opening the door today. The lady has already started smelling a rat and she knows her goose is bouta get cooked. She is really curious. We hurriedly get inside the bedroom and she follows us quickly. Right now she knows that I know. ""Aki, beb naskia kizunguzungu"" She starts getting dramatic and drops on the floor. I turn and look at her on the floor; she wants to convince us that she has fainted. She wants to distract us but we ain't buying into her story. Not today sis! 

We must first smoke out this male version. Just like some of you suggested, we took a mopstick and started poking under the bed. ""Aaii! Aaii!"" Please I can explain"" So he's still alive. We keep poking, now harder. ""Manze, mtaniumiza joh, tulia natoka"" then he starts coughing. The guy I was with (backup) could not keep calm, grabbed one of his leg and pulled him half-out. His head still under the bed. 

On the other side, this lady's eyes were now open. She was witnessing the rapture first-hand. ""Aki beb I can explain...please"", now she's crying profusely. I notice she's crying in a low tone, careful not to attract attention. It is her moment of embarrassment. Ladies can get dramatic, yaani we have not even completed the face-reveal of his boyfriend and she's throwing tantrums. ""Shit, baby, aki ni shetani. Beeb am sorry.."" Mai lawd, how do you drag the devil in this mess. She stands and starts pacing across the floor, she's shaking. She kneels, stands again. She falls, then rolls on the floor. It is her moment to shine, let her shine.

Back to our guy. Now, this man don't wanna come out. It is like he's clutching on to something. We pull, he's coming along with the bed. We pull again. We ain't here for games brother. I step on his knee so hard, but in a way that pleases God. ""Aii, manze *insert my name* pole mahn, acha niwaambie kila kitu.."" Already I recognize his voice. We give one last pull. Behold, Ladies and Gentlemen, this man, in shorts, and a shirt, the man who enjoyed free accommodation and even overslept has given in to pressure. He's now exposed. Her girlfriend also looks surprised, was she expecting to see someone else.? He's out, but does not want to lift his face, he's engulfed in shame. My guess was right, he's my close friend. I feel betrayed and disappointed, I thought I had overcame these feelings.

I peep under the bed and what I saw caught my eye. This man did not sleep on the floor like we all thought. He slept on that lady's pink towel which was well spread down there (photo attached). Though small, but it was enough to give him some kind of protection from the cold floor. Buana, if I were to wait for this guy to sneeze or cough as a result of the cold floor, I would still be waiting until now. In his hand, he's holding his inhaler. 🥱 Yaani, this guy was just comfortable down here like this, I even now start to think, he slept, unlike me who stayed up all night. Hii lazima alipe. I just had to slap him so hard for that mistake, how dare he sleep, on a warm and heavy towel. Nkt!

Now the confessions start. They have been doing this for like two months now, and yesternight they were planning to try it while she's on her menses. Lawd!. What kind of fetish! After a short interrogation, it is evident, I have lost, they have won. I can't continue but free them. I ask him where are his pants and he points to the wardrobe. ""Haya, as you take your pants from that wardrobe, help her pack her clothes which are in the same closet."" ""You have won yourself a brand new second-hand wife"" I added. That statement alone made that gal cry so bitterly. Kwani she thought I was here for conflict resolution, I am not Koffi Annan. Jokes on her if she thought, I would diss the guy and hug her tight. I dissed them both, and sent them packing. I can't hear more of those apologies. Hizo pole zimetosha.

Alot is going on right now that I can't type. In a few minutes they'll be gone. But first, they should shower together and go out clean. I hope they live happily and have big-headed children. Until now, the sound of that slap, echoes in this room, and I wish it echoes in that empty head of his forever. Bye!

1bpgw04,Kenya,1711583041.0,"Time has moved so fast. 01:47 A.M I am already seated in my house. I told you guys it will be peaceful.😄 Right now I am typing while sipping some hot tea, you can make yours too and enjoy the read. Based on True Events. So let's start.

Around 2 hours ago I embarked on my mission. I vowed to ensure that this lady knows that I know abt their relationship, not through text, but mambo laivuuu. By 0023 I was in this compound, normally the gate is always locked past 11pm but I got the key. Accompanied with a friend,  this mission had to be completed. He was to serve as a mtu wa mkono and a witness. The entire apartment was already dead silent. So, we tiptoed to my door. From the giggles and low voices I heard inside, I could confirm that the two love birds were already inside and were enjoying this night. Ahaa! I am about to spoil their moment. I don't want to be heard, I want to be seen.

Knock! Knock! I Knock. Then once again. They have stopped talking and it seems, they are getting ready to respond to the call. I hear her coming towards the door, she always drags her legs on the floor. ""Ni nani?"" she asks. I don't respond. I Knock once again. I can now hear her boyfriend asking ""Na kwani haongei.."" How could he.? That son of a bitch asking as if he was in his home. I could feel my anger rising but I had to stay composed. She switches on the security lights, opens the curtains trying to steal a gaze of who might be knocking!. Surpriseee!!!! It is me. 

I could see it in her eyes she's already shocked. She closes it immediately. At this point, I don't know what they are doing inside there but najua habari tayari ishafikia boyfriend that mwenye nyumba is at the door. I give her time because she must open this door today, besides, there is no back door. The entry is the only exit!. She finally opens the door after around 20mins. I signal my backup to wait outside there, mambo ikichemka ndo aingie.

""Ghai, beb! Kwani kumeendaje?"" She is already trembling. Her voice shaking. She is in a dera.
""Shit!, ghai! Sasa hata hautanihug"" Her face is filled with fear. 
By this time I am still standing at the door. Stone-faced. I swear I really wanted to slap this gal so hard and spit on her face but i maintained my cool. She was trying to maintain her normal smile but she couldn't hold the tears. I move forward, and get inside the house, I turn, take the padlock from her hand and I lock the door, keys still intact in my hand. No one is getting out of this house tonight. My eyes scan around the room, there is no sign of him. I walk calmly to the bathroom, nikakojoa and released some tension. I had swore I will act normal.

So I get out of the bathroom, head into the bedroom. Haha. Ninja is nowhere to be seen. All this while, she is following me, fast-paced, pretending to be concerned.
""Beb, Mbona hukusema utarudi nikupikie?"" She is growing frustrated because I am silent all this while. I only utter the words ""Yes"" or ""No"" because the rage I have inside will come out when I decide to utter more words. I head to the wardrobe pretending to search for some fresh clothes, he's not there. I checked the living room while heading here and I did not see him either. This is one-bedroom house and now I am 100% sure he is hiding under the bed. I will not bother him, let him sleep there. He thinks he is brave, let him brave the cold hapo chini kwa tiles.

Huyu naye kazi ni kunifuata kila mahali na kuniuliza maswali. ""Nikuwekee maji moto uoge?"" ""Aki, mbona sasa ukuje hii usiku yote"", ""Si ungenipigia nikukujie kwa barabara"" nkt, as if she always picks me up. I wish she could know I am not interested. She is really tensed and keeps on cursing ""shit!, F$ck!""etc. I head to the kitchen make some hot tea and head to straight to the bedroom. I bring along a glass of cold water because this lady is already sweating and I hand it to her. She looks surprised. I think she needs it because tonight she will be sweating and crying, the water will keep her hydrated. At least I still care😁. I lock the bedroom door.

Sasa right now, we are in bed. I know we are three people in this room. She knows I know we are two people. I switch off the lights!. This lady beside me is restless, she's trying to act normal but she can't. She starts crying once again. ""Sasa unalia nini na ulikuwa na siku mzima ya kulia"" I ask her. ""Aki beb cramps inaniuma"" Hehe! ""Cramps gani na nilikuskia ukicheka"" I ask her. ""I was on a videocall na Kate yule Cuzo wangu nilikuambia anaenda majuu"" she responds. Eei! Yaani she can still lie. Ma-liar huyu! ""Na mbona unatetemeka"" I inquire. ""Kuna baridi akii"" she says and comes closer. ""Kuna baridi na unasweat, are you normal?"" I interject her. ""Beb, aki ni vile periods za raundii zimekuja na maubaya"". I smirk.

""Beb, si unishike tulale,"" she says as she comes more closer. Right now, I know she needs me to sleep ndio afungulie boyfriend mlango. She wants to sneak him out. ""Wewe lala, na uache kunisumbua"" i respond. In fact, now I am not sleeping. I sit by the bed, take my laptop and start checking nothing. My response has triggered her tears, she is now crying silently blaming period pains but I know it is devil under this bed. If I could be her I could utilize my last night and sleep. This guy under this bed will have to sleep there tonight, he already saw it wise to sleep there, so I won't bother him. I chuckle when I remember yesterday we met at a chemist akitafuta dawa za chest pains juu ya baridi. So he came to my house tonight expecting to be sleeping in the warmth of this lady and on my bed. Now see his life, he's under.  If he sleeps there until morning, he will wake up with more chest pains, or maybe he will critically ill. I know he's asthmatic, but that is least of my worry right now.

Infact, nataka kuwatch Dexter series. I hear this Dexter guy is a psycho, but I am yet to find out tonight.😄😄With my cup of insomnia, today I am not sleeping. To you reading this, wait for the last episode of this crazy drama. We said we are doing it slowly and peacefully. It is a movie night! Goodnight from the three of us. Cheers!

Scrap metal dealings will put your life in unnecessary risk. There is a kavillage I passed  where guys were asking for my blood. If you're to be a scrap dealer, at least be the person buying from the scrap collectors not the collector.

My family and I are still coming to terms with it, and thanks to numerous support received from this Sub, I am grateful to know I am not alone in losing a sibling and that others have gone through the same.

Honestly, I am ridden with guilt and wishes of things I could have done better. I am even broken by the fact that only me and my other sister have our minds right as of now. We are just going through the motions standing besides our mom in this tough times. 

My sister was 32 years and had a lot to live for. I wish each day I wake up I would have carried the pain she suffered in her years, but what's done is done.

Today I want to appreciate those who've reached out to be in person and in previous post. Thank you. I was thinking of ways of taking myself out, but I'll try my best to live an honorable life. 

If you still want to reach out and be part of the process, through donation or physical please send me a DM and we shall proceed from there.

So today after we woke up, and as I was preparing myself for my ""journey"" this lady complained of a migraine and mild abdominal pains. Guess what, she's on her menses. Mahn! Just when my plan was about to click, the periods came. I had not factored in this event and I had to go back to the drawing board. Her menses would mean that they wouldn't meet as they had earlier agreed.

So I quickly logged in pale whatsapp and saw her reporting the unexpected phenomenon. I could sense disappointment from how the guy responded. Again, the guy was like he wants to raincheck their meet-up but now mi lady is insisting that her whole body is aching and cramps are taking a toll on her, all she needs is a full-body massage. Waah. So they agree that he will come over to give this full-body massage. Maii Lawd, I wonder if the massage will escalate to proper strokes.😅

Whether I find them massaging, or reading constitution, or even watching movies they must acknowledge my presence around. Just like the messiah, I'll go in peace. Today is the day she leaves. Only a few hours counting! Tick, Tock!

1bohjzx,Kenya,1711483486.0,"Hello guys, here's an interesting one and I need your insights.

So lately I suspected my girlfriend was cheating. You see, I normally leave her to go for work in far places and I can take upto 2 months to return home. So recently, I came back and noticed she has these weird behaviors as if she is hiding something. I asked her but she denied vehemently. Now after gathering some small Intel with my little CID tactics, it is likely that the guy she is seeing is my close friend.

So I came up with a plan to catch them red handed, staki mtu aseme anasingiziwa. Yesterday I told her that I will not be available on Wednesday and immediately she invited that guy over and told him that I will be away. How did I know?. I linked her whatsapp on my laptop and I can follow their convo. So guys tomorrow is the day. I know their meet up will probably be at night. Personally, I am not going anywhere and this is just a plan that once they are inside, I come later, unannounced!. 

Who has ever experienced this?. What did you do upon entering that house?. I am still confused on what actions I'll take upon entering that house. I don't want any blood shed. I only want to do something that will terrorize both of them mentally but I haven't figured it out. Should I enter and lock the door, and then tell the man to continue sleeping with her, as I will sleep on the couch?. Or should I just give em silent treatment? I don't want a fight which may cause unnecessary police cases when someone is injured.

N.B I am fed up with this r/ship and I don't want to be involved with this lady ever again. Right now she's besides me acting like everything is okay😁😁This gender!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1bohjzx/my_cheating_girlfriend_please_help/,🚨My cheating girlfriend.

wrdvyb,Kenya,1660810818.0,"I was arrested yesterday at Globe Roundabout. They suspected me of being in possession of weed, which I was. The 4 officers(in civilian clothing) wanted to search me and I knew I was fucked. But your guy knows the constitution.

 1. You have the right to privacy, which means you can refuse to be searched.
2. If arrested, the police officer should identify him/herself and give a valid reason for arrest.

I used this knowledge and my Zeus-level confidence to gain power over the officers. If you've ever been arrested before, you know that the police often use intimidation tactics to scare you. So they put me in chains and threatened to take me to Central.

 ""Tukikupata na bangi ata moja kijana, utajua."" 
""Mimi sivutangi io vitu, nipeleke station tuambiane na wakubwa wenyu""

We eventually get to Central, and the officers ask me to stop. 

""Kijana toa bangi""
""Nawaambia sina bangi, kwanini tumesimama, situingie""

The officers take me to their store room or something and continue with the threats. My heart was beating hard af but I ain't no b***h. I was willing to call their bluff.

One of the officers suggests, ""Huyu tumpeleke kwa mkubwa."" So they call the ""mkubwa,"" who tells them to bring me in. Luckily, the mkubwa is a cool lady. I tell her my situation, that I was arrested and the police tried to violate my rights. After a lengthy conversation they realized I knew the law and I was finally released. I also used this line to play with their minds, ""Kama ningekuwa na bangi, singeitikia wanilete station, tungemalizana kwa barabara."" Worked like a charm😂

You should have seen me walking through the Central corridor, with a bag of weed in my pockets. You remember that scene in infinity war where thanos gets all infinity stones. I could feel myself powering up(from the power I just absorbed from the officers) I AM INEVITABLE

I posses so many skills and instead of asking for handouts here I would want to offer my skills and knowledge at a fee. The skill I feel I can put in play at the moment is I literally know all the cheap places for almost everything (Benefits of being in survival mode most of my life) and I mean everything and anything.

First of, if in need for clothes, shoes or related things. I know Gikomba market in and out since I used to have a thrift shop 5 years ago and I have been shopping their myself for the longest time.
 
Good quality khaki pants (100-200)
Mens jeans, official pants (100-300)
Shirts and Tshirts (100-200)
Offical coats and blazers (300-500)
2-3 piece suits (800 - 1500)
Silk tops and pajamas (30-60)
Mens shoes; Original Vans, Converse (400-500)
Sneakers (500-1000)
Women’s shoes; Vans and converse (200-400) if you are a size 5 and below and (300-500) if you are a size 6 - 8

Overralls, Duvets, Fleece Blankets, Carpets, Caps, Bags, Belts, Curtains, Blankets, Tracksuits, Denim jackets, Leather jackets, Sweatshirts, Boots and heels etc

This is just a short list of the things I can type out right now but if its in Gikomba I can take you to where they sell it. I’m also a very good bargainer so be pretty sure you won’t be knocked off.

I’m charging 1500 for up to 3 hrs of shopping per person. I can also do personal shopping and deliver to you but we can discuss this further on my dm’s.

Incase of anything else you might want me to plug you with reach out in my dm’s or comments.

15outvw,Kenya,1691814881.0,"A few weeks ago I made a post about a certain girl I had a crush on and wanted to call and ask for a date.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/15c1p6j/how_am_i_going_to_get_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1

Most of you said I should move on and stop simping, well, I did. Just a few days later, after morning classes I was going to my friend's place to chill with them as I waited for afternoon classes. I was walking and saw her like a few metres ahead, I called her and told her to slow down so we can walk together, she stays close to my friends'. 

With all your comments in mind, I absolutely had no intention of asking her out or anything. We just had a casual chat, about school, studies, life. Since I had no intention of impressing her I was really calm, the normal me, unlike how I stated in the post that conversations with her felt awkward.

It was through the small talk that I learned she won't be in school next semester, and it will be my last semester. Exams were about to start, meaning very few classes and chances of meeting her again were really slim, I was like well, my guy, this is your one and only time.

We were about to part ways and I had to come clean to her. I mentioned that I really thought I liked her, but, quote on quote from a comment I got, desire can't be negotiated. I told her she was really pretty, which she is, and for someone I only know by their first name and nothing else, she crosses my mind an unhealthy number of times. Note that I only told her this just to get it off my mind and not to pursue her. Because honestly, alikuwa amenimaliza na sio uongo. I genuinely felt like I loved her, yet I didn't even know her. Most of you (Male mostly ) can attest, being in a relationship is one thing, but being in love, very different. It was like the third time I was in love in my entire 20+ years of existence. 

Anyway, we part ways, after telling her that the discussion we just had never happened, and if she ever saw me in school she should just ignore me. I really hoped I never bumped into her again. Woo, I felt lighter. Few hours later, I got a whatsapp message ""Were you honest about what you said earlier?"" I figured it was her. I tried to stall and ignore her but after a second message from her I replied.

From that day we have been talking almost daily, the vibes are really on point . Apparently she was just shy and the thought of her texting someone first seemed off (women☕) And also,I said on a comment in the linked post that I found her staring at me a couple of times,she said that it was a way of grabbing my attention and she really hoped I could go over and talk to her (women again☕) Anyway, anytime in the past two weeks that we are both in school, we always hang out. This week we didn't meet much because it was exams week, but we both really longed to see each other at the end of the week.

Yesterday, she came over to my place, made her dinner, I really can't believe it is real, haha. She is currently dead asleep by my side (I guess that is what collecting four fire rounds back to back does to someone)

1bwnwl9,Kenya,1712338281.0,"I've come to realise that the US embassy is one of, if not the most exploitative, and pathetic institutions in the world.

For those who might not be aware, the US visa application is as follows: Fill out very sensitive data in their online questionnaire > upload very personal documents in the said questionnaire > Pay a mandatory non-refundable visa application fee (current cost is $185) > Schedule an interview appointment.

From there, the ball is in their court. They decide whether or not to approve your application.

Bare in mind, this is Africa. A third-world continent. A shit-hole as one of their former presidents termed it. $180 is by no means an insignificant amount to the ordinary mwananchi. Coupled with miscellaneous costs such as passport processing fees, transport etc.... These can snowball quick. 

So you arrive at the embassy, fingers crossed hoping fortune will be on your side. As you queue, you notice some interviewees wailing remorsefully as they leave the teller, with a pink document at hand. 

Anxiety kicks in. 

Finally, it's your turn. The interviewer, a very unattractive, out-of-shape, tired-looking madam asks, condescendingly, ""Mr. So and so, do you have a spouse?""

You reply ""No""

""Do you have any children?"" 

""No""

""Unfortunately, your visa application has been denied"" - Then she hands you that pink document I was talking about.

You exit the embassy $185 poorer. 

As for the terminally ill parent that you were intending to visit, you're gonna have to Skype until she comes back home in a casket.

I reiterate, the US embassy is one of, if not the most exploitative, and pathetic institutions in the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1bwnwl9/dear_us_embassy_shame_on_you/,"Dear US Embassy, shame on you!",Discussion ,238,238,0.93

17fhvd9,Kenya,1698167577.0,"What do you guys think of the bill proposed by CJ Koome to decriminalize prostitution. If there is one business that is booming in Kenya it is prostitution in various shapes and forms. Dating apps are pure prostitution apps these days. Many campus girls engage in kulaing wababas in exchange for sex, that is prostitution. We all know that all these massage places are just brothels in disguise. I bet many here on the sub are prostitutes, they are everywhere if we are honest. Most guys nowadays except me sleep with prostitutes coz they are just all over and most women ask for money for salon, nails, fare and they are just all the same as prostitutes on the streets to men. 😒 

I support the move by CJ Koome to legalize prostitution:

1. Prostitutes should pay taxes. They are making alot of money tax free at the moment. It should be legalized and taxes.

2. If prostitution is made legal, it can protect prostitutes who will be free to report clients who abuse them or take advantage of them.

3. Prostitution is already happening and it is rampant. All these spas are actually prostitution going on in our neighborhoods. They make it look like massage but huko ndani it is simple prostitution.

4. We can have sex tourism to boost tourism revenue and forex earnings.

5. Rules can be set once it is legal to ensure that only willing adults participate in the business.

6. We can have online forms of prostitution like onlyfans and so on to give more people a chance to make money.",https://i.redd.it/z0ykgne2o6wb1.jpg,Legalizing of Prostitution,Ask r/kenya,222,175,0.93

rxb663,Kenya,1641463914.0,"Long post ahead

So, yesterday, i went grocery shopping a bit late and got home at around 7. The main entrance to our apartment was locked, and i neighbor is outside the gate waiting for someone to come to his aid. I make fun of his situation & open the gate as i head to my house. Our appartment isn't big , so even though i hardly know anyone by name... I have lived in the same house and building for two years so i know my neighbors faces. This guy in particular, i had spoken to, just the usual greetings, trying to be a friendly neighbor, a couple of times. So the guy thanks me for letting him in, and proposes that he comes to my place for dinner. Naturally, i am an introvert, i rarely have people in my house, but part of my new year resolution is to be more friendly & meet new people. This is my neighbor, he lives a floor below me & i literally have to pass by his apartment every time i have to go in & out of the apartment building. He has been living in the apartment for over an year, he seems harmless enough so i agree.
I head to my house, prepare my meal & its around 9 when i am done. I don't have his number so i decide to wait for a few minutes to see if he will show up or not. about 10 minutes later, he shows up. with him there i take the necessary precautions i usually take while hanging out with new people. I text my sister his details and don't lock the door. I am not about to lock a stranger in the house with myself. I put on a movie which i love and serve us food. We eat, he is great company. 
We finish eating we finish up the movie while making small talk here and there.
Like an hour in, the guy turns to me & says i have something to tell you, i am like ok, go on. The guy says he has seen me around for the past year & he likes me. I give an awkward ""ok"" he proceeds to ask, so what are we going to do about it. I respond, ""nothing, I don't know you."" He insists that i know him we live in the same apartment, he literally lives in the apartment below me. I tell him that is not enough information for me to consider it knowing a person. He insists that i know him. I insist that i dont. At this point its getting weird so i say i am sleepy it is time for him to leave. The guy says he will not leave without a kiss. I insist no. He asks why. I say I don't want to. Plus i am in a relationship. This guy lives next to the apartment entrance, i am a hundred percent sure he has seen me & my boyfriend coming in & out of the appartment severally. I insist that i would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship. He tells me my boyfriend is not around so he won't know. I affirm that i will know, kissing him is wrong whether my boyfriend knows or not so i will not do it. This guy will not take a no for an answer. So i suggest, i will give him a peck or maybe a kiss when he is at the door on his way out. My thought process is when he is up,i will push him out & lock the door. The guy refuses, he insists that i must give him s kiss there, on the sofa. I insist i won't. 
At this point i just want the guy to leave my house. Two things you need to know, i am petite & i live in a studio apartment. So this guy at this point carries me to my bed and gets on top of me. I am freaking out at this point. I am pushing him away but he is not having it. Compared to him...i have no chance. I am kicking, shoving, shaking my whole body. He is not having it. I am shouting at this point. He is telling me to relax as he forcibly tries to push his fingers through my short. I am wiggling around & making the whole thing so difficult. I ask the guy ""what do you think you are doing?"" At this point i am frustrated. I have told him multiple times to get off me. He is not bulging. I have told him countless times that i do not want to do whatever he want, he is not bulging. The guy replies that we are having sex. I tell him this is not sex, he is trying to rape me. The guy does not bulge. Rather, he seems frustrated with my continued refusal and puts one of his hand on my neck. At this point i am scared shitless. I literally think this is how i am going to die. He pins me down. At this point in my head all i can think of is the last thing that would happen to me in my life is have someone rape me in my own home. I would rather die.
I try reaching around but the only thing i can reach is a pillow, that wont do any damage. I am scared, he is almost getting through my shorts. So i decide it a do or die situation. He was so focused on getting my short off that he was not paying attention on the hand on my neck. I manage to bite him. He gets it off. I tell him to get off me or i will scream. Remember the door is open. This scares him, he gets of me. I tell him to get out of my house. He scatters. At the door he has the audacity to say ""see you tomorrow"".
I get back in the house & lock the door. I am scared. My neck is sore. I can feel some pain on my shoulder. I cant believe what just happened. I am staring at the celling for hours trying to digest the whole thing. Its 4am the next time i check the clock. I haven't slept at all. Every small movement frightens me. What if he tries to break into my house & tries it again. I finally drift off.
I am awake again at 6am.
I cant even bring myself to believe what happened. I am a bit calmer now so i can think rationally. I wonder what the guys thought process was. Why would anyone want to rape a neighbor knowing very well that we would see each other every day. I can identify him to the police.
I think about reporting the case, but what would i say. I live in Kenya. Just like most African countries, rape cases here are not given the seriousness it deserves. Attempted rape cases are even worse in this case. What would i even say. Would anyone believe me? People would think i asked for it simply because i let the guy in my house at night. If i reported it, i literally had zero evidence of the whole thing, i don't know if neighbors had the exchange. If anyone had, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't come to my aid. I feel broken. A bit lost. I just don't understand what i did wrong. Even if the penetration did not happen, i kinda understand why people do not report such cases. 
I called my sister in the morning & told her what happened. I am still scared. I still have to see this guy every day. I want to tell my boyfriend but i don't know how he will react, he is unpredictable. I want to forget the whole thing but i don't know how. For F**ksake, i have been locked up in my house the whole day. I know i need to get out at some point.

I don't know how to deal with the whole thing. I remember the face the guy had when i made it clear that what he was trying to do was rape. He wasn't shocked. That is what scared me the most. Clearly he has done this before, he probably might do it again. & That is what breaks my heart the most. I like to think i am strong & independent but never have i ever felt so weak in my life. I can't even bring myself to expose his face. I don't know how to deal honestly. Psychologically i am a mess. So much for meeting new people this year..




UPDATE
I HAVE REPORTED THE CASE TO THE POLICE. HE ADMITTED WHAT HE DID, SO THAT GIVES ME A BIT OF PEACE. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT & ADVICE, IT REALLY GAVE ME THE STRENGTH I NEEDED. I HAVE ALSO SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY BOYFRIEND & FAMILY. THANK YOU EVERY ONE.

FINAL UPDATE....After i reported the case to the police, the guy was arrested & spent the night in a police cell. Looking back at the whole thing, i admit that i did make some wrong calls along the way but even so, that does not give anyone the right to force themselves on me. All i wanted from the situation was for the guy to know what he did was wrong. That actions have consequences so that in future, he understands that if & when he choses to engage in any form of sexual contact, both parties should be in agreement. I made the personal decision not to take the case to court but rather, have the guy experience some form consequences for his actions. The guy will be moving out of the appartment. Also, he has to make weekly visits to the police station for assessment & punishment. Hopefully, he learns from this experience.
I want to thank all of you for the kind words & support & thank the very good ladies at the sexual and gbv office at the police station i reported the case at. At no point during my interaction with them did i feel judged. They were very helpful & understanding. All i can do now is try & put this situation behind me and move on. Lessons were learnt. I am no way close to recovery, but i will definitely be taking it one day at a time...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rxb663/almost_got_raped_yesterday/,Almost got raped yesterday,,219,148,0.97

13tv2n0,Kenya,1685262261.0,"I always wonder why my experiences are different from the guys who post here...

I have dated 4 girls since high school. Two of them when I didn't have any money. I never took them to a date. I only heard in this subreddit that people go on dates that cost 4k and above. 

My current gf and I live an average lifestyle. She is a maid and I am a fundi.

For some context I live in a poor neighborhood in naivasha. All the men I work with have girlfriends and even wives. Even the guy who brings us food has a girlfriend.

 So when you guys say all women love money it doesn't make sense to me. 

90% of women in Kenya are married to men who make less than 50k a month. Most men here make less than 30k if that.

I have seen all kinds of guys who had a partner. Disabled men, poor men, ugly men.

I have also seen all kinds of women get married. Disabled women, poor women, ugly women. 
There is someone for everyone. 

And the topic of single mothers. If a foreigner saw this subreddit, they would think no one wants single mothers. Reality is they get married in real life here in Kenya. 

The same way they would think that Kenyan society is a woke irreligious one where even LGBTQ community is tolerated. Reality is Kenya is a very religious society. 95% of Kenyans don't support the LGBTQ. 

Anyway whenever I see misogyny in this subreddit I always conclude that this subreddit doesn't represent Kenyan society. I don't even bother replying to those comments. Maybe some guys here are incels or don't know how to form a genuine romantic relationship. Maybe some of the posts are not genuine.

Maybe most of you guys live in the richer parts of Nairobi. Maybe the women who live there have very high standards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/13tv2n0/what_kind_of_women_are_you_guys_dating/,What kind of women are you guys dating?,Ask r/kenya,211,206,0.93

Mombasa and the Kenyan Coast needs to evolve. The Islamic oppression there is too much. Also the Islamic control.

Especially because the Islamic Arabs and Omani people found the indigenous Kenyan Mijikenda people there before they brought their oppressive Islamic ideologies of covering up women in that extreme heat. 

It has become a nonsensical society controlled by ideologies that suit those in control. The Kenyan Coast should be like an international tourist beach destination. Not oppressive Islamic region.

 Historically, the indigenous women of the Coast (the Mijikenda) never wore anything on top. Now they have to cover up so much because some Arabs who came by sea from Oman and Saudi Arabia were uncomfortable with those practices of the indigenous people they found there? Swipe images to view how the Bantu Kamba women (4th photo) used to dress and how the Bantu Mijikenda women (2nd photo) used to dress. Very similar dress code to the Bantu Zulu of South Africa who also are traditionally topless. 

They were basically always topless  traditionally. 

To add insult to injury, the drug lords who run the drug cartels that fuel the oppression of the Mombasa youth are mostly Islamic politically affiliated leaders. They also oppress the men by selling drugs to them for profit. They make money while our young men stay dependent on the white powder. The irony! Forcing  women to cover up in extreme heat, and then still profit from the sell of drugs through the Mombasa port! 

Back to the dressing. Plenty of female tourists feel unsafe dressing freely in Mombasa as they would in other international hot weather beach destinations. That's why most eventually go where they feel safe. The Islamic oppression is heavy and gloomy. 

For female tourists who are on a girls' trip, or any other trip, being able to dress freely, without being cat-called by men, ogled at by the men and women, judged or groped, is crucial.

The tourism industry is one of the largest income generator for this country. Mombasa needs to wake up to this reality and let evolution, growth and respect of cultural diversity prevail. Especially because it was never an Islamic region in the first place!

Given everything that happened in my life I never even once imagined making it to 20.
At 17 I was diagnosed with cancer, leukemia and the odds weren’t good, and the only reason it was caught was because I attempted to OD.
~
At 18 1/2 It Finally went in remission and last month marked 3 years of me being in remission…so 2 more years and I will be cancer free (if it remains in remission)
~
When I think of everything I have been able to achieve and accomplish up to now, it just seems a bit surreal
~
The first couple of months when I was diagnosed I was numb and then I was scared and then I realized that I did not in fact want to die (reminded me of a book called “Veronica Must Die”) and I had a therapist I was working with and they suggested I make a “Bucket List” and try to do as many as I can….I couldn’t think of a single thing I wanted to do…I did want to visit that library in Switzerland that that boy and girl from “The fault in our star” visited but It was supposed to be with my best friend who unfortunately died from suicide a couple of weeks prior to my diagnosis.
~
One thing I can say is taken for granted is having a good bill of health…..I have always been the sick child, when I was born I had to be incubated and undergo a few surgeries just to keep me alive….I do not know what it means to not feel or be sick😅
And so when the cancer diagnosis came in I knew for a fact that I wouldn’t make it.
~
So here’s to reaching 21 and hopefully beating cancer at 23.

To my suprise, there is not even a SINGLE public library in the whole county. A whole county and no single library yet every corner I go through there’s a bar, club or wines and spirits shop. 

We complain here all the time reasons why we’re a shithole country and this is one of the reasons why. 

Anyway, I decided to go to the McMillan Library near the Jamia Mosque (I’m getting used to the mosque noises by now). 

Apart from that, I have to go to Upper Hill or Buruburu to go to a Library all of which are very far away.

I called my dad earlier today to share some new developments in my life and also to hear his insights on the same.
He, however, was busy so I said I was gone call him later.
He asked ‘is everything okay?’ to which I said ‘yes, I just wanted to talk to you about something but no pressure’.
I then hang up.
He texted me ‘are you okay? Are you pregnant? Please talk to me’.

My dad has never ever sent me a message, ever. He always calls.
I broke down.
I called him and explained the situation at hand and he listened patiently and advised me.
He has been calling me every single minute to share more insights.

Now, my dad is my favorite human on earth and I know he would give his life for me in a breathe.
He's the first person I call when I want to talk about anything whether good or bad.
The other day he told me that he has been rearing chicken which he intends to slaughter for us on Christmas Day and New Years. Just how cute.

I've just sat and thought ‘wow, just how blessed am I!’ I hope all girls with present dads get to experience this love always. Knowing that someone is in your corner always is pure bliss.

134xodk,Kenya,1682966770.0,"The craziest thing happened to me and i thought it would make for some great reddit content. So I went clubbing last night. Even though i find clubs to be one giant cesspool, i went and that made it to the list of bad decisions i've made in life. I quite literally got bitten.

This was the order of events;

A friend invites me to join him at the afterparty of some event, but they were pregaming at the club first. I say okay, i'll join you at the club but i can't go for the party, I have to go home early. I make sure everything's in order at home, cleaned up, cooked supper, then hit my mum with the 'acha niende hivi nacome' Soon as i'm out of the house i set an alarm for two hours later(this will be important later on) And, i'm wearing sweatpants( also important later).

So i go, meet this guy (lets call him Z ), he's there with his friends and he introduces me as 'his woman'. I'm surprised yes, but i decide to go along with it because it's all in good fun, right? Wrong. Anyways, it was fun, got along pretty well with the people at the table, some nice 'shouting over the music' conversations, it's all good. A few hours in some lady(let's call her ""Cardi WannaB"") shows up out of nowhere, grabs Z by the hand and leads him sijui where. Some questioning looks around the table and i'm not sure how to feel about this...So i go to the washroom.

Coming back, i find Cardi WannaB at the table and Z introduces us. Again he introdues me as his girl and her as his sister..or at least that's what i heard. At this point everyone is looking at us, and i sense some underlying BS. I smile, say hi and extend my hand and she gives me the most off-ish greeting then turns to Z and starts going off on him. In my head i'm thinking okay this is my cue i should leave before things get messy. By good grace, my alarm goes of and i act like it was a phonecall. I go back to the table, telll everyone it was nice to meet them but i have to leave.A few pleas of 'oooh dont gooo'. Sijui shida ya walevi na kuacha watu waende home hukua gani.  😂

Sasa Z decides to follow me, asking me not to leave mara it's not what you think. The girl is steady behind him. I stop in the parking lot to tell them it's all good but Cardi WannaB has other plans. She's like 'acha aende' then pushes me. Ugh. I take a good look at her in her little skirt , 50 inch stick ons and faux lashes that could be used as umbrellas and decide it's not worth it. Nikamwambia 'Mami, sijui shida yako na mimi ni gani but i'm leaving anyway so you relax and have fun' I walk away smiling thinking how i handled that shit with grace.

Weh, no sooner had i taken two steps than this B-word pulls my hair. Then she starts doing some catfight moves on me. I get enraged, i think if it's a fight you want, a fight you shall get. One good push and she's on the ground, i'm on top of her and give her square punches on the face, making sure Cardi WannaB goes home with two black eyes. The whole world had disappeared it was just me and this little B-word and i was taking out all my rage on her. The whole time i'm thinking 'where did i even learn to fight'

Eventually, i'm pulled of her, and during this process, she gives me one good bite on the thigh, hadi i started bleeding, mind you i'm in sweatpants. I noticed there was a crowd gathered around, and Z was standing there in shock. I get up compose myself and the girl is dragged away. People ask why we were fighting and even I  have no idea. I continue with my journey home, Z still following me, and mind you it's drizzling. I didn't sign up for this telemundo bs. I told him i'm good, we'll talk, go check on your 'sister'. Sister kumbe ashaa amka and she's coming my way. Did this woman have a deathwish? In a good turn of events, Z's friends who had witnessed some part of this, start going off on her, telling her things like ata avae nini she can't match up . I'm confused, first of all, kwani si sister? Second, these people have no idea who i am, match up aje sasa.

Anyways, I take advantage of the ongoing chaos and make my way home once again.

Now here i am, with some deep bite marks on my thigh, reading horror stories of people who died or contacted some weird shit from human bites. And i still have no idea why she came at me in the first place.

Anyways, on Tuesday I found out I was pregnant. It was very unexpected. For the past week I had been feeling nauseated and thought I had gut issues which I rarely have as I try to eat healthy. I was at a salon getting my hair and nails done so I went to withdraw some money at the chemist and we got talking with the kind lady. Long story short, she did a pregnancy test for me which turned out positive and as a 26 year old who is very child free, it was a surreal feeling. 

I went through a myriad of emotions to say the least. Anxiety, happiness, sadness and so on. I thought about the life within me and I felt like it would be a son and I was so happy for that but then again I don't want to be any one's parent atleast not under the circumstances this baby was conceived... Why would I willingly be a single mother? Why would I traumatize my child with questions about who his father is? So I made up my mind and there's no turning back. 

I know everyone's opinion on abortion is different but in my time of need, I am glad that I had the privilege to access such an essential service because it is healthcare. May God forgive me and make it easier for me.

Edit 1:  I didn't want to say that I was assaulted because that would make y'all sympathetic for me but oh boy are you lot evil. People in my DMS wishing me death really? Was it that serious? Anyways I'm doing good actually and if that hurts you so be it. I'm peaceful and happy in my decision and I am in no pain.

You also notice the woman has a young son who is visibly shaken and traumatized by her mother’s actions. This is how the average Kenyan woman behaves behind closed doors and we are getting a first hand experience of what many husbands go through.

Before we hit it off, I asked her if she was in a serious relationship or in a situationship, but she dodged my question the entire day. I went to her the next day and posed the same question, and she confidently told me, “Yes*, I am seeing someone, but I want you. I want you to fight and compete with the other guy, and I will choose who I want*”. I abruptly told her I was too old for that shit. I do not compete for women because other important places in life need my energy and focus.

I have been scammed by these chinese but I learned how not to be frustrated by them.i have sold pegs for my mom on Jumia that she was sourcing from Kamukunji and made sales then operated at a loss because of listing them in a category where shipping was the same  price of the product without knowing I was doing the wrong thing.  


You see not giving up and learning new things is the best thing I have experienced. I blog too and everything that I know I learned online.  


If you want to learn new skills for free go to 

* YouTube,
* skillshare(free trial) 
* LinkedIn learning (free trial)

From these sites you can learn anything. Then list your skills on either your website,**fiverr** or **upwork**. Then from there advertise yourself with *google ads,FB ads , email marketing and native advertising*.   


**Here are some things you can do from home and generate revenue either part-time or full-time**  


1. **Teach what you are good at** \- This is done best by creating online courses. Record yourself or your computer screen. Create a course of like 6 hours Then post these videos  on sites like teachable,udemy, LinkedIn learning,skillshare and that way you will start having students enroll. I host my online school where I teach affiliate marketing on thinkific. I like it coz payment is instant and I pay commission to no one. 
2. **Social media support** \- most companies are selling online. Reach out to them and let them know you can respond to their customer questions on their Facebook inbox, WhatsApp, instagram, twitter. To also attract more customers you can have a simple website that will cost you like $50 to construct and drive traffic to it through ads and let potential clients book appointments with you. Avoid face to face meetings they are a waste of time. Instead do zoom meetings
3. **Blog** \- Do not under estimate blogging there are people making a sustainable income from it. Create a simple blog with WordPress . Write articles of what you are good at. At first you will not be monitized by adsense,ezoic or any other company you familiar with but guess what you can add affiliate links to your blog posts and generate very good income. The best affiliate company I use is CJ affiliate they give nice commissions
4. **Youtube** \- create videos of anything, to make money with these videos add affiliate links on the description. I created my YouTube channel back in 2017 reviewed a program and added affiliate link of their course that I was recommending in one month I had made $1000 in commission from the video and it had not even reached 500 views. Also I run ads and recommended my course and out of $2.50 I spent on youtube discovery ad I would make 2-4 sales a day and my course was costing $11.99. you don't need a good camera for youtube your phone is enough,your computer screen is enough
5. **Sell products online** \- you can sell products on Jumia,jiji,kilimall or your own website. The easiest place I got a sale was actually Jumia. If you want to sell on your own website run ads they bring customers very quickly. Another thing source products from kamukunji or eastleigh and if you want them customized/private label turn to alibaba  


Don't sit back and say there are no jobs convert your skill to an opportunity that makes you money.

vr3uxv,Kenya,1656928449.0,"20s can be the pits! Been there. Its like getting lost in an alien forest in an uninhabited alien world. But never give up. Here is my story - perhaps it can help someone out there who is losing all hope.

My story: I was supposed to graduate from uni in 2008, but i got suspended, and ended up graduating 3 yrs later in 2010. Then my father refused to pay my uni fees and living expenses, and left home to chase skirts with gratuity money. I found a job in a cyber. Back then surfing the internet using airtime was too expensive so everyone went to cybers. My mom really helped me out. Cleared my fees and supported me until i graduated. But when you have studied law, graduating out of uni is nothing. You cannot be employed unless as a clerk. You must go to Kenya School of Law for 1 year, then pupillage for 6 months, get admitted, then get employed as the lowest ranking ""punda"" in a law firm. KSL fees had doubled from 45k, to 90k then 190k, then add living expenses. KSL easily meant you spending not less than 300k.

We didn't have 300k let alone 190k fees. So i stayed at home as my uni classmates, finished KSL, got jobs in law firms, ODPP, judiciary, NGOs and what not. I could not face anyone. Sent applications everywhere but everyone wanted a lawyer who has been admitted to the bar. I became a shamba boy helping my mom feed cows, planting cabbages, going barefoot to cut napier grass for the cows etc. I would rarely leave our farm lest be seen by neighbors and provide the week's gossip. 

I hit the lowest of low but i never sank to drinking or drugs or fapping or contemplated suicide. aAll my boxers were so old, but i had no money to buy new ones and i could not ask my mom. Did not want to burden her more. The manual/physical farm labour kept my mind and body busy. I would work on the farm even when its raining unless the rain became hard, until darkness forced me to call it a day. The next day, the same thing. 

By sheer luck, we got some kiasi windfall and by then, i had given up on law altogether and resolved to do business or something else but not law. That lady convinced me to go back to KSL and finish, get admitted and then come back and pursue whatever i wanted. I did not want to but i listened. Went back to KSL in 2013 (5 yrs after my uni classmates), a month late after reporting date. So much was alien in the legal field, new constitution, new land laws, new police laws etc. Threw myself so hard at studies from Feb to Dec, sleeping only 4-6 hrs during that time. 

Hard work saved me. Life totally changed after KSL. I am can't believe that i am living a life that i could not even dare dream of. So chin up and grind on, or hang in there. The best is yet to come.

And oh, in 2011-12, I lived in Majengo slums where when i wanted to go and eat or buy from a shp, i carried only 50/- or 100/- and my ID. In case cops stopped me, my would show them my ID, in case thugs stopped me, they will only steal the 50/- or 100/-. My body would take a whole week without doing a number 2 because the toilets where i stayed were... wacha tu! On sundays, i would go to a new toilet at Gikosh and pay 20/- and stay inside for 1 hr, just enjoying how a clean toilet is.

I still recall those days and believe that nothing will ever faze me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/vr3uxv/the_20s_can_be_the_pits_but/,The 20s can be the pits but..,,180,33,0.99

""Na wewe hunanga bitches bana, uko rainbow gang,  nini?""

At this point I'm confused coz I have a girl I'm seeing, we not together yet but we satisfy each other's needs, iykyk

The guy attacking me is the womanizer of the group. Man's in a ""committed"" relationship w/ his gf but every time we go out without our girls, he either pulls up w/ a different girl, calls one up or picks one up at whatever establishment we're enjoying at.

The problem is, girls are expensive and no one will tell me otherwise. My bro proves me right coz now we have to finance his sexcapades (he pays us back eventually) and he always talks about how he feels like shit after spending the night w/ a girl that's not his gf (yet he keeps on doing it) but it got me thinking, like what's really the pros of having many women, as a dude coz dudes be having a ton of girls that do nothing for them

We have slept hungry more times than I can count. Not because he's jobless, he just preferred alcohol and women to feeding us. 
We are his last priority. Even when fees was 1000 a year, he still didn't pay. But you'd see him with new shoes and clothes. 
We started getting older and noticing his infidelity. As kids we just thought money was tight and didn't mind. But you get older and it's pretty obvious. 

When we got to our teens he completely let go. Rent he didn't even try. Previously we've been kicked out of houses like thrice but he at least paid 3 times a year or so. We got older and we had to start hustling fast. 

He encouraged as to get boyfriends to get some money. So you get 500 for fare, 200 you spend on fare and 300 you buy food for the family. He was very comfortable. 

He discouraged us from being tied to one man and play men for money. When my sister confronted him about one of his affairs while we had no food he said ""how can you talk about this girl, you push with married men too"". 

Now we've moved out and he's become those village drunks pushing with girls everywhere. My mom is still complaining, idk why. My sister amepotea kabisa and when you try to talk to her she says ""I'm my father's daughter"". 

If your father left, don't feel too bad. You might not be missing out on too much.

EDIT:I didn't expect this post to blow up like this. I made it because I saw someone complain that they'd be more stable if their dad was there. I was like ""maybe, maybe not. Be happy with the life you have. Don't assume you're missing out.

If you're a good dad congrats - I appreciate you even if you're not mine. You make the world a better place.

3days in and my phone was stolen. I went to the police and they asked me to pay 5k to track it. The phone itself cost 6k. Haha. 

I didn't give up and my aunt gave me some money to buy another phone. 

I was scammed out of money in eastleigh. 

I try to ask for directions from people, either they ignore me or are rude. 

I asked for a mat to go to kariorkor and the guy told me I had the right matatu. I paid 100 only to find out other people paid less. He didn't even take me to kariorkor. He took me to town. I took a motorbike and the guy demanded I give him 500. 

I have lived in naivasha most of my life and never been scammed. You can even walk at night with no problems.

1977uf7,Kenya,1705322548.0,"I want to address the question:

""Why are ladies always quick to meet men they don't know at Airbnb?""

My response:

As long as a killer is set on harming you, they'll find a way to do it.

Even if you meticulously do your due diligence, a determined person will carry out their intentions.

If someone is determined to kill you, sitting in their mother's face and learning all the details about their son won't prevent it.

If someone is determined to kill you, the safety measures you provide for yourself may not be enough.

If someone wants to kill you, meeting them in an open space for the first time or even at their mother's house for the third time won't deter them.

You will be killed the day you feel comfortable and secure around these people.

Your throat will be slit in your house on their fourth visit.

The reality is that being a victim is not entirely within your control; it lies in the hands of the perpetrators.

This is why even well-known figures can be caught off guard.

Remember the fate of Musando and Jacob Juma, along with the women they were with; they likely had no idea that their last joyous drink at a restaurant would be their final moments alive.

If they knew, I'm sure they'd have protected themselves well.

We need to stop blaming the victims.

We need to start seeing things as they are because no one is safe if killers are roaming around freely.

Nobody deserves to be killed for any reason.

No one should have the power to end a life.

Let's stop showcasing our virtuousness on social media using tragedies.

15ctus5,Kenya,1690641393.0,"This goes out to the young men because I have zero perspective of the female experience. I know some of you are tired of the relationship posts, but I've noticed two fairly recent posts here of people speculating about whether someone they like fancies them or not. The short answer is no, they don't. 

I've not lived long, I'm 27. However, in my relatively short time in this earth, I've learned that if someone is actually interested in you, they will proactively show interest in spending time with you. If a person is not interested in you, they won't explicitly say no to you hence much of the confusion that our young lads are going through. The only time someone will explicitly say no is when you have pushed them to the edge by being too persistent, or if they were raised in a low context culture where direct, explicit communication is valued (I would believe Kenyans operate in a high context culture; [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures)). 

Case in point.

You ask a girl out on a date, perhaps you tell her that you'd like to take her out for lunch or go for a common activity together and she tells you something along the lines of ""I'll let you know if I'll come"" ~~and she doesn't~~, ""I'm busy that day"", ""I'm not sure"" etc... all while **not** suggesting alternative (**definite**) dates, you for sure have your answer, that is her saying no without explicitly saying no. 

Alternatively, you ask someone out, then they explicitly say yes, or if they are unavailable, they suggest alternative timing then you are for sure spot on that this person is interested in you, this person is worth investing your time and resources into! Additionally, there is a certain ""vibe"" that someone who is interested in you will give off, you can sometimes sense the excitement that they are harbouring for you. They will literally fight to spend time and interact with you if given the chance. 

In conclusion. Anything that isn't a ""yes"" is a no and you would be best advised not to waste your time chasing someone who doesn't want to chase you. Secondly, leave extreme persistence for the movies. Sometimes it's for your own good that this person is not interested. You two might be incompatible, or the other person may simply be taken, and they are protecting their existing relationship. It's best just to take a no at face value and avoid hurting yourself in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/15ctus5/they_are_simply_not_that_into_you/,They are simply not that into you!,Relationships,172,62,0.99

My list has has more than 50 types of food that are commonly referred to as Middle class delicacies  that i intend to taste before my days are over.I made a money box to try to achieve this without affecting my survival and my dependant's.

Topping my list was Biryani. Jeez! Man biryani is tastier than people give it credit for. After saving like 500/=. I went to a nearby Swahili hotel that makes biryani for a family for 500/=.
Man, from the aromal I could tell my 500/= hadn't gone to waste. I was so excited when they wrapped the biryani with chicken curry for take a way that a distance of 1/2 a kilometer journey back felt like a trip to the Moon and back. I can't remember the many times I smelled that aluminium foil paper to catch that biryani aroma.

There was no time to waste when I got home. Unwrapped the foil paper and served it to the three of us. Man, I can't say enough. Biryani is super tasty. I could eat biryani all days of my life with zero complain. My poor palate fell in love with biryani yesterday.  Biryani is amazing my God.  I hope when the time comes to try my next meal on my list it will be this satisfying.

After her brother slutshamed her for wearing pants? That's me. A lot has happened since then. Shortly after I escaped, my mother showed up at my work place and I ended up being fired. In the Somali culture it is abhorrent for a woman to be on her own. My boss was related to my mom. It was a big drama and my mother cried in the boardroom telling me to come back home to which I refused. Rightfully so, I was tired of the physical and emotional abuse in that house. Home, the first place I ever wanted to ran away from. My colleague's sister accommodated me when I was jobless. Thank God for the savings I had, I never lacked anything.

 After 20 days, I got another job, opposite my former workplace and the pay was 10k higher. Bingo, things were falling in place for little ole me and I started securing a one bedroom house in Uthiru. I was happy, relieved that the bad times were behind me now. Manipulation and guilt trips from my mom never ceased but I never  budged This time my mother got pneumonia and begged me to come back home. She said if she dies it's my fault. I felt bad and went to visit. Never planned on moving back but didn't tell them upfront cause they won't hear it. Now, I smoked weed at that time, but they didn't know till my brother snooped a phone I used to use and found videos of me getting lit. This day, the day my whole world would fall apart, I had a blunt in my bag.My sister and I had a fight and my brother ganged up on me and beat me up. I was livid  and really hated my family for all the abuse subjected to me and went into a rage mode, breaking the dishes. The sorry excuse my mother birthed violently put me on the floor and held both of my hands firmly. I was stuck.  

My face was bleeding, I puked, couldn't move. My mom finds the blunt in my bag and she is hurling abuses at me. I hear her call my uncle to come with cops who arrest me and detain me in Pangani. The whole matter took a distasteful turn and I found myself sleeping on the cold hard floor using my shoe as a pillow, 3 days later, my mom comes and tells me to come back home. Big No from my side. She leaves me and a day later, they are back, I am discharged but I don't see my mother. The cops and my uncle. Writing about this makes feel sad and helpless. I am forced into a car and I was like where are you guys taking me? I hear the taxi driver being directed to Mama Fatuma road and I find myself in this 'rehabilitation centre' called Mustakim. I fought hard but I was overpowered. Five men forcefully dragged me to that hellhole and after I saw that fighting bore no fruits I surrendered. Since when is rehabilitation forced on someone? They are boys and girls locked up there for different reasons, mentally challenged, elderly, criminals hiding from the police.

 I realised I had seen that hellhole before. In a documentary titled as rehab nightmare. I spent 124 days there, 4 months. The food was shit, the girls were bullies. I was bullied and almost fell into depression. I am not a religious muslim and adapting there was hard. Covering up all the time. It was mandatory to attend Madrasa at 7am and throughout the day.Failure to do so you are beaten up. Cameras all over, electric fencing to deter escaping. Literally prison.  After I stood up to a bully,  the management intervened and the girls pinned it on me fearing the bullies. I was locked up in this very small, dark torture room called Room 10, the place everyone feared. I was chained, beaten and cold water poured on me many times. 

They were good times, where we sung and danced together despite our problems and differences,flirting with the boys chini ya maji since we are not allowed to talk.This one girl had been there for a year and four months. I've been discharged five days ago and freedom is strange. I am not allowed to leave the house. I lost my job, my house and my life. Now I feel dead inside. I've become a shell of my old self. I wonder how such an illicit place could exist, corruption is the answer, the cops are paid off by your family, the owner bribes Nacada. It is a well connected system.Someone was locked up because he married a non Somali. This guy, his wife committed suicide wondering where he disappeared to. Too much pain.  I reached out to Nacada and they don't care. Go watch Rehab nightmare on Bbc.

 It is so fucking hard talking to my family and interacting with them, I isolate myself and my mom says she feels sad seeing me like that. Newsflash! You did that to me. I feel pity for myself for being birthed by her. I wish I didn't exist. I just wanna shut that place down and I don't know how

Because in the mornings kanges usually get asinine when you give them a 1000 bob note, I decided to pay with the 1000 bob and for good measure add the 30 bob so that I would get 950 bob change (fare is 80 bob to my destination). Anyway I pay and just chill and watch YouTube shorts knowing I'll get my change later. A short distance from my stage I remind the makanga to give me the balance......wacha jamaa aniruke. Ati, ""wewe mbuyu umelipa 80. Tunawajua sana wezi."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This idiot not only was he refusing to give me change, he had just called me a thief. Me, a father of boys. A respected banker. Admin of several WhatsApp groups.

I felt holy indignation rising through my veins. I wouldn't let this guy get away with this as a matter of principle. My inner John Wick rose to surface and for a moment I forgot I was 40 and overweight and I was ready to go toe to toe with the inbred. Wacha ni pige kelele nikimwambia mimi si rika yake. Wacha tu escalate kesi kwa CEO wa gari, dere. Dere ako hapo ame changanyikiwa wondering who to believe. Eventually wisdom rained on the driver and on discerning that I'm a respectable member of society, and makangas penchant for their unchristian ways, he told the nincompoop to give me back the change.

Feeling vindicated, as I walked away, I gave the conductor and the semiconductors that had congregated to witness the spectacle, a look to suggest that they should choose better prey the next time.

I get home and as I am dissecting the events that had just happened, I put my hand in one of my pockets and the unmistakable texture of a crisp 1000 bob is felt. Intact.

Edit: After weeks, I finally met the makanga. I asked for his number, he was confused because I made sure I had paid the fare with the exact change, I sent him a thousand bob. He finally remembered me and told me the way that money had pained him. I apologized and explained my side of the story. Tukasema poa poa with that nod. Mambo ikaisha.

17wh1ot,Kenya,1700119527.0,"I just realized that I'm actually eyeing age 30.
Just a couple of years and I'll be talking about ‘when I was in my twenties’.
I'm not scared of growing old, it's aging while single that I'm concerned about.

So now I have decided that I shall not wait for no man to hit on me. I'll go after whomever it is that I want.
So yesterday I began my quest for searching for a life partner.

I was leaving Lang’ata with a friend of mine and we boarded the first mat we saw. The sun was scorching hot so standing at the stage waiting for mats wasn't an option.
It was a rusty matatu that was making grunting noises.

The conductor opened the front door for us and ushered us in, you would think we were some distinguished guests. The front seat makes me feel like I'm not just a regular passenger. I mean, it's not every day you get to sit next to the driver and strike a conversation. Even helping him insult other drivers on the road like ‘sasa huyu mwendawazimu anafanya nini kwa Barabara!’ I usually help with those ones. I can even help my driver recognize a drunk driver and a learner. 
Sometimes I ask about their job, family etc. This one time I alighted and told my driver, ‘love you babe’ intentionally, and he blushed.

Anyway, when we were getting to town, one of those dramatic traffic officers stopped all the vehicles from our side near some roundabout. Just adjacent to our vehicle was another maroon matatu. I noticed the driver was a rastaman and the mat was playing reggae music.
I nearly asked  him ‘will you marry me’? But I hesitated and said ‘niaje mras’ he replied while smiling ‘poa sana empress’ and my mind was like ‘you could be my emperor my love!’ but instead my mouth asked ‘unabeba route gani, nitakuja unibebe?’ Me, I could tell he can drive me crazy.
My guy smiled from ear to ear.

By this time, everyone in my mat was staring at me and the rest in my rastaman’s mat were opening windows and craning their necks outside to see me. My Rasta reduced the music volume to zero and told me that he plys along Langata road too.

I could imagine how many of them had tried to ask him to reduce the volume but he had adamantly refused yet here he was, reducing it so that he could talk to a girl. But it wasn't just a girl, it was me, her gorgeousness.
Coincidentally, the song that was playing was Nice to Know you by J Boog. The stars were aligning. It was nice to meet the love of my life.
I'm relocating to Lang’ata guys.

17wkpwe,Kenya,1700134327.0,"Living in Eastlands is so ghetto.
I'm in my house enjoying my lunch of six chapatis and ndengu when I hear a vigorous knock on my door. I nearly choked. Honestly, pretty much less than five people know where I live and none of them has the right to come knocking at my house as they wish, so it definitely was not any of them.

I also already paid my rent for the next two months and cleared all my bills including the Takataka collector whom I dodge daily. So of course it wasn't about my bills.

I don't have a boyfriend, and even if I did, I would break up with him if he knocked on my door at noon instead of being out there breaking his back, working his arse off to buy me a beach house, and a car. So there's no way it was my bf.

I took a huge ass bite of my chapati debating on whether to open the door or not. I couldn't peep through my window coz the person would definitely see me and that would be so weird.
The knocking became persistent so I got up to open and our hands met at the door knob as the person was trying to confirm if the door was locked.

I find a huge luo-looking man outside and he asks ‘wapi mama mwenye nyumba?’ I was taken aback wondering whether I looked like a husband or a child. So I asked ‘Mama yupi?’ he said ‘Mwenye nyumba. Ama baba?’
There's no way I took a break from enjoying my chapo to engage in such a conversation. I was infuriated.
‘Nani anaishi hapa, coz last time I checked I lived here and paid my rent?’ I asked calmly though I was planning to yell.
He apologized lightly for mistaking me to be a child and began explaining that he was selling dawa ya mende.

Surely. We come across dawa za mende all over Eastlando, they even have songs composed purposely to market ‘dawa ya mende, kunguni na viroboto.’ So why would I bypass all that to come to wait for a random dude to come to sell it to me in my house?
Anyway, I told him that I didn't need them and fought the urge to slam the door in his face coz I'm a good Christian.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/17wkpwe/eastlands/,Eastlands,Casual,153,231,0.96

Majority said I break up with him and I was scared I had to. I was hoping more married people would contribute but that's not the population of the sub. 

I did see some people say I should talk to him. And I did. I didn't tell him I want to break up. I asked him what was wrong and if the foundation we're setting is good for a realistic relationship. 

He has been trying a lot. I just didn't know. He was ashamed of telling me the hustles he was doing because I make way more money. He has been paying a school fees debt and since I was offering to cater for the relationship financially he was comfortable and he apologised for that. 

He has lost weight. He is eating better but hasn't gotten to gym spirits but it's okay. 

He did say the sex thing he'll improve. He just doesn't have experience. And we've been working on that and it's 300 percent better. 

He just started a new 8 to 5. He's so much more alive. And still a very nice guy.

Unfortunately my father passed away when I was about 2 years old so I never really met him but we do hang out with his sister who lives here in Kenya.

I'm not really writing for a particular reason. But I've noticed a few things.

a) people assume i don't speak kiswahili. Bro/sis, mi ni mwenyeji, isinione hivi hivi.

b) Some business people, especially mitumba guys assume they can rip me off. - I remember going to town and wanting a really nice jacket. Women's clothes are generally much cheaper than men's clothes, especially second hand. The guy wanted to sell me a jacket that couldn't have been worth more than 600 for a whopping 5k... It was honestly amusing. I have other incidences, but this is the only one that comes to mind.

c) I used to get ""special treatment"" in primary/high school. People would treat me like an egg and I hated it! It felt almost condescending sometimes.

d) People assume I'm rich. I'm not... Apart from having a car, mambo kinaniramba with the high cost of living. I'm not safe from Zakayos's wrath.

e) I've witnessed men who have made lewd sexual remarks in front of me about me (in kiswahili, thus assuming that idk what they are saying)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/19c1bfl/mixed_race_kenyans/,Mixed race Kenyans,Discussion,145,143,0.99

So, we all left together since everyone had errands to run. So I ask Tim the nature of their relationship, he sàys she just a friend he is hosting since she got locked out her house.

Anyway now that I look at you it my mum is also to blame. Fast forward my mum is a stay at home mum dad was the only breadwinner at home but everyday mum was always occupied with church stuff mara sijui chama........

Dad stopped going to church 2 years ago after the death of my sister ever since he started cutting people off and he would tell me how all this people I see around him aren't really his friends....he always stayed alone and he didn't associate with people. I didn't know what to tell him ju yeye cause he is older than me and plus I'm good not good at such stuff. He also used to tell me how he feels lonely at home cause my mum is usually not at home on Sundays and that is when my dad was free. So I used to go home almost every weekend so I can keep him company.

Then my uncles and aunties (his siblings) started having land issues and so he offered to cater for the land division etc ju he was a land surveyor they used to stress him out. And he had no one to talk to.  So fast forward to when he committed suicide.....

It was on a Friday he called me in the morning and asked me how school is I told him school is fine we talked for a while about how we would go take my sister to school for the form one admissions everything was fine when we talked. Until in the evening when I called him and my mum picks up my phone crying I asked her what is wrong and she told me that my dad was in hospital so I go home the next day and that's when I'm told what happened.....my dad died on Sunday.

I later found out that on that day at around midday he called everyone (apart from me) he was crying and even after all that nobody cared about where he was and what he was doing.......it hurts till this day but I understand why he did what he did  and now mentally I'm not okay I just wish I had someone to talk to",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/11rrzr4/my_dad_committed_suicide/,my dad committed suicide.......,Discussion,146,97,0.98

It takes no brainer to realize that evil and selfishness go to great lengths to bring offspring to languish in poverty, sickness, and/or suffering. It takes a sociopath to take nefariously selfish actions to purposefully endanger and anguish an innocent being.
 
The government should enforce child rights and punish men and women who fail to provide standard shelter, clothing, education, and a balanced diet. In developed countries, such incompetent individuals would be thrown in prison for child neglect, and as it is in those countries, it should be in Kenya. They should be imprisoned, and their children should be sent to an environment conducive to their well-being and future.
 
No child wishes to be born; they're not guilty of being born. Children's rights are inalienable and should be protected from sociopaths. Adults who make a choice to raise children must support and firmly hold the responsibility of their children.

The last Muratina was aged for 6 months with 8% abv alcohol, I decided to go a little overboard  by distilling it, after several failed attempts and getting ***drunk on my own supplies*** I have nailed it down and  here are the results *drums rolling......* 

 allow me to introduce the first ever in the History of traditional Kikuyu brewing Muratina liquor at staggering **40% ABV**, finally! a clean traditional spirit for Kenyans,   I used a copper coil condenser for distillation, achieved **100 proof** alcohol then aged the liquor by soaking Muratina pods in the liquor for 6 months to create complex chemical reactions that occur between the distillate spirit and the Muratina  to produce aromatic flavors on the palate and achieve that golden brown color, spring water *(spring water has minerals which add smooth taste and enhanced flavors )*  was used to dilute the liquor to 80 proof 40% ABV 

the flavor is honey like balanced with a herbal taste of the Muratina

To you guys, it may sound like a simple post, but as a counsellor, I'm telling you there's so much shit out there. I've seen cases where women who engage men in gender wars to the point where she had enough rage to strangle her mzungu boyfriend to death, got away with it, sold his shit while investigations were going on, and the son was forced to have her present in the post mortem. 

Please be careful what you post. The more you post this misadrisg and misogynist bullshit, the more someone might think of doing something crazy. This gender war bullshit helps no one. Men lose and women too. I've watched grown men crying like babies in the therapy sessions because he's realised the wife he neglected is never coming back.

It is end of the year and for men planning their resolutions for 2024, I just want to encourage you to work hard. I have been there and I did it.

If you are in your early 20s, you will feel hopeless especially when called brokies here but soldier on. 

I graduated at 23 as a peasant with only an EE degree. My first salary was 20k pale parklands. Few months later,  girlfriend got her first job at Safaricom. Even though we were dating madharau zikaanza as she was making more than I.

The best thing with me is that I move on quickly. I don’t invest a lot on somebody emotionally na nikajitoa.

 Worked on myself, getting skills in what was hot then (blockchain technology was just new then). I started programming from html, php, JavaScript, python, mobile development, etc. But I wasn’t happy. I wasn’t made to be a developer but an engineer. 

I did PLC programming pale Centurion and that’s when I got interest in embedded systems especially FPGA.. I got few projects on my name and then two years later I quit my job to pursue MSc abroad. By then my job increases my salary to 40k.. 😏.

MSc done.. First job, I was being paid 450k and after a year I got 750k. Three years down the line I’m at 1.3m and this will continue increasing as my experience increases with several projects on my name.

I’m 30 now. Not married , no baby mamas and I can do what I want whenever I want. I have financial freedom to not work anymore and travel the world but I love my projects and I continue to do so as I travel the world.

Several women who rejected me including my ex, all are chasing me because I have my shit together. There is no better feeling than being chased by women. Basically you choose who you want and as you travel around you meet several high quality women looking for men like me. You decide who to bring to your world.

The take lways for men:

1. Put your head down. Work on your skills, projects. Work hard knowing that there is somebody somewhere working 24hrs a day to take it all from you. Follow the 10000hours rule.

2. Approach women but let them not be your priority. Don’t chase women.

3. Don’t invest in emotionally in something that can be taken away from you. A job, a person, a company.. You will be emotional defeated when it is taken away from you.

4. Look for a mentor in the field you want. Mentors are important. They will connect you with the best in your industry.

5. Read books. It will open your viewpoint on a lot of things on the world.

6. Go to gym if you are capable. Your health is your wealth. Nothing is sweeter when you have money and your health.

7. Your 30s will thank you only if you put the work. It will be hard during the first few years, but just continue. You will look at those moments and you will laugh it out loud. Sometimes I wish I could have done extra things but nonetheless I’m here.


Good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/18ueluu/men_work_hard_in_your_20s_you_will_thank_yourself/,Men; work hard in your 20s. You will thank yourself in your 30s.,Relationships,142,107,0.95

14dhqy9,Kenya,1687188597.0,"I am 26 and male.  Mimi ata sijui nianze wapi.  I've been locked out of my crib since March coz I hadn't paid rent since January.  I've been living in with my parents. They don't even how deep I am in debt. I don't tell them coz they're financially strapped too. I've got siblings but wueh!! Life yao ni payday to payday so I avoid bugging them given it is hard for them to get by as it is plus zakayo is coming for their unimproved salaries 😂. I am about 200k in personal debt including unpaid rent but not including helb(78k). Very unemployed and in any case I get a gig, money goes to debt financing after food and airtime. FR my bills are those two only. Can't travel. Can't date. Sherehe ni ya kuitiwa with a signed affidavit that I am not paying for anything. Only entertainment is movies on the go. Avoiding dating is funny and hard because I am generally funny so I find myself in situationships haziishi. Basically I cheat emotionally 🥲😂. I have good loyal friends but they broke. I guess average income of my four friends is around 17k highest being 22k and it gets delayed AF. I could start a hustle but capital  ni tricky kupata while you're in debt so I stick to little online gigs that bring in like 7k a month.
It's bad for me economically but I can't say I am on the ledge. Depression has been having my back but I think I am at acceptance stage juu I feel happier of late. Landlord has been nice to me. He doesn't hassle me but has insisted on opening my door once I am only two months in debt but if it hits Jan 2024 he's gonna have to auction my two cents belongings. 
My situation has been brought about by my own financial mistakes. Majorly using debt to finance debt kama gava tu. 😂😂😂 I believe I am smart but hapo Kwa pesa mimi ni fala tu. Until last year august, I was making good money per month but I'd prioritize on the wrongs things. I'd make like 70k then save like one or two K. I like traveling so much of my money went to that. Once I started noticing cracks in my finances I'd think I'd have a financial breakthrough in no time but as soon elections came, then dollar did it's thing and life became more expensive zile cracks zikakuwa earthquakes. Momentarily after swearing in ya wsr markets started improving but life expenses went up so I started undertaking debts and in by Dec I had moved from a one bedroom to a bedsitter. I had to sell off some stuff juu ya space but I can't really tell you what I did with the money. One bad mistake you'd ever do is start selling your household goods for whatever reason yenye sio kureplace with new one or you have surplus juu you'll always get bad prices for the value they gave you ata kama they were old. Also it makes you view everything as money mazee utauza Hadi chakula. 😂😂😂

Wueh!! Ata nachoka kutype. I don't really think I am saying all this for online pity or paybills but more like to elimisha people. 

*Always have a budget. Mainly have a bare minimum budget of basics. Food, rent, water, electricity and transport. Hapo kwa food make a meal plan and stick with it. 
*Save in a sacco. KSH 50 per day is as good as a KSH 10000 a month.
* Loans are only good for well thought and planned investments ata kama ni kibanda. Omba ex wako pesa ya supper but usijaribu kukopa Tala pesa ya supper. 
* Avoid 30 day loans. 
*Invest in a good health cover. Mpesa app has that afya something tab incase private insurance is too expensive for you. 
* Have a lawyer. Ata kama ni beshte amefanya law. Let them know they are your go to people incase umeshikwa masaa mbaya or any unlawful arrest. Some of these things need lawyers sio thao mbili ya kukutoa. 
*Hii maneno ya kucutoff people every new year is BS you never know when you'll need your village. 
*Lipa family na  mabeshte  wako first. These are the people you'll need as witnesses Kwa biz deals na guarantors kwa bank and stuff. 
*2027 vote smart people. 😂😂😂😂

He gets all mad and I decide to call her using my phone. She explains everything (been dating for almost a year now and she thinks she’s having a miscarriage) I wake his lil siz up he gets mad and smashes my iPhone and starts beating me up claiming the girl is lying.

I can only talk about this cause I've fully healed.Around 2018 I tried selling a PS4 Slim console on Jiji, for around Kes. 30,000/=

An Airtel number gives me a call claiming to be interested,me excited, knowing I'm gonna make a quick buck (I really was cash-strapped at the time) arranges a meeting.

The guy, who claimed to have a sick son at MP Shah Hosp. in Parklands and wanted to gift the boy this console, agreed we meet...In retrospect,he was full of red flags that I just didn't want to see.

So on the fateful day I take my ps4 slim,2 pads and FIFA 19, put them in a bag and leave for Parklands. I get near MP Shah,I call and call and call,no response. I'm now close to the hospital entrance I call again,no answer.

20 mins later this guy calls back, apparently he was in his sons ward but he's out now and in a White Toyota Premio and he's even seen me, he signals me,I go enter his ride (all holy car,small bible on the dash,crucifix hung on the rearview mirror, car stereo playing catholic songs)he checks the PS4 slim,and he likes it.

Now we have to leave the car and go to his ""office"" nearby so he can check if it powers on ""juu ashai conniwa hio Jiji akabuy ps4 yenye haiwaki""😂

Bro,he even encourages me to leave the bag inside the vehicle ""itakua tu safe"" I comply,we leave the car he carries the Ps4 and leads the way to like a mini shop complex near-by.

Here goes the cold water. There was an upstairs space in this complex that was supposed to be his office,my mans alikua anapanda stairs 4 ama 5 at a time.Sijui alinipotelea aje...Mimi kufika juu,hio place ni salon/cosmetics shop. A lady dusting the counter.

""Umeona mtu amebeba Ps4 na pad mbili ameingia hapa sahii?""

""Ps4 ni nini,hakuna mtu ameingia hapa,ndio tunafungua kazi""came the reply. 

My buttcrack is sweating.Im nauseated.

Nikarudi chini mbio (equally 5 stairs at a time) headed to where our Premio was parked,Premio ni wewe.Haiko.Im feeling like puking,knees are weak.Hata fare ilikua kwa ile bag yetu😂😂

Knees give in,I sit down on the gravel.watchman comes.""Kijana uko mgonjwa?"" Silence ""...Kijana...kijana unazuia watu ebu songa uketi kwa pavement!!""
Nimeibiwa.I meekly reply...

""Kuna Gari imetoka tu hapa sahii,amesema ako na emergency..."" Sweet baby Jesus!! I confirm my fears.Call the number...Mteja.

Corruption is so ingrained into the Kenyan society I’m not even sure of the best way to solve that, if even possible. I blame one person, rather one family: the first family. 

In primary school we were taught that Jomo was a freedom fighter and the truth is that he was just a shitty shitty guy who Jaramogi let to be president just cause he was in good with ypipo. In power he shafted Jaramogi and stole half the country and shared with his fabled “kikuyu mafia” (responsible for several high profile killings including that of JM Kariuki)

He started this cronyism we see that is so rife in our country right now. Kenya is not a meritocracy and it has never been. 

Years down the line his son has outdone his father in terms of plunder. This country has gone to the dogs. To the point he can brazenly claim on live tv that 2 billion disappears everyday. Can you imagine? You wake up everyday at 6am. Enter a shitty matatu that is unroadworthy, go to the unsafest part of Nairobi, CBD. If you survive pickpockets on your way to the stage, big up yourself. You go work at a shitty office with a shitty boss and earn a shitty salary. Then go back to CBD, walk like you’re in a walk race so as not to attract muggers then you finally get home. 
At the end of the day, 30% is taken from your hard earned money so you can get “services”. 
Our roads are shitty, our healthcare system is non existent among other terrible things. 


I tell my family these things but they’re “uthamakis”. They do not see it as the premier’s fault. They think he just hired the wrong people. Lol 
They call me brainwashed by my Nairobi friends. Because I speak against him. They say if Uhuru says jump they ask how high. I’m always angry at family gatherings because I’m very political.

So, last night, the memories of this IG baddie whom I dated some years back randomly crossed my mind. 

Since she was a popular figure in the streets of Instagram, I always felt trapped. I couldn't shout at her. I couldn't get angry at her. I couldn't reject any of her requests. All because I was afraid she would ANNOUNCE IT TO THE FUCKIN WORLD! 

And it looks like she realized this weakness and dedicated her life to maximizing it for her benefit. 

First, to make sure I wasn't going to initiate a break-up with her, she posted a photo of her in a red dress, with the caption ""Next dude who breaks my heart, I'm telling the whole world he left me for another dude"". 

And the post went viral. IT WENT FUCKING VIRAL!! 

I was trapped fr because I wasn't ready to accommodate the thoughts of being referred to as gay. 

Another day, we had a little argument in the morning when we were still in bed. We solved it quickly and even made love immediately after. After that, she woke up, prepared some breakfast, and we had it in bed. That morning I had eaten twice already. 

With empty balls and a full belly, I wanted nothing else on this world other than my phone. Then I stumbled upon her most recent post on Instagram, updated just some minutes ago. 

It was a sexy photo of her which had a caption that read ""3 inches feels like 9 when you are in love"".

Imagine borrowing a total of US$ 7.1 billion through Eurobonds. Then over the repayment period, paying a total of $14.25 billion back. Meaning, as a country - you incurred (will incur) interest of US$ 7.15 billion that is MORE than the principal you got from the lenders.

The second worst part is this: to repay the principal - you need to go back to the same guys you borrowed from for money to repay them (after they took interest from you that is more than the principal they gave you).

The worst part is this: you borrowed when the exchange rate was around KShs 100/US$. Now, the exchange rate is approaching KShs 160/US$ meaning your debt in KShs just went up by 60%.

Meaning if you had a pot that you set aside for debt repayment, that pot better be up by 60% to afford this repayment.

Palestinian solidarity marches have been commonplace across Africa with sights from Cape Town to Cairo and now Nairobi. 

However, the Kenyan leg has not been as smooth. Dozens of placard-wielding demonstrators calling for a just and lasting resolution to the Palestinian question were arrested on Thursday. It follows last month’s police raid on private premises where Pro-Palestinian supporters had gathered.

Kenya has had close relations with Israel across all administrations. For example, in 1976, Kenya allowed Israel to use its territory to carry out an operation in Entebbe, Uganda, to free captured Israeli hostages. 

Today, Kenya still maintains ties in agriculture, security and trade, with bilateral deals with Israel totalling $500m in 2022.

Maybe that had something to do with President Ruto’s strong statement of support for Tel Aviv after the Hamas attacks on October 7th.

I usually video call every morning and evening to say hi but this morning in Kenya when she called me I said hi to both her and my son. Now they were both lying on the bed at that time, and as I was talking to him I see a pair of legs in the background on the bed as well. Immediately I’m alarmed and ask whose legs are those. No reply, I ask twice more and my wife responds asking what’s wrong? I knew there were man’s legs and that her brother was already staying with them but I immediately jumped to the conclusion that he was sleeping in the same bed as my wife and my son. 

She immediately covers his legs with a blanket after I ask if that is your brother sleeping there. After that I told her that I can’t talk to her right now because it is very awkward. My reaction is pissed off because of the fact that another man who is 17 is sleeping in my marriage bed with my wife and even my one year old son.

He says “incase it happens”, a good wife should protect the hubby and act like nothing happened, incase someone intervenes.

uuhpzl,Kenya,1653116320.0,"So, this is just my own opinion from my own perspective and experience. 

Do not have a wedding that you cannot afford! About six years ago at the ripe age of 27, my college sweetheart and I decided to tie the knot. She was two years younger than me and from a slightly better off family than mine. 

The total budget for our wedding was ksh 1,118,000 (lumping in dowry and the wedding. I paid 200k for dowry, so wedding was about 918,000). I also raised 400,000 from savings (my entire savings actually), took a loan of 300,000 and received 300,000 from the contributions of family (mostly hers) and friends. 

I won't go into so many details, but paying off that 300k while also handling domestic financial responsibilities took a major toll on me. I no longer had any money for leisure or my personal projects. This in turn took a strain on the marriage and we divorced 3 years ago, we have one child with whom we share custody and I feel like I let him down the most in all of this. I won't blame just the wedding for the failure of our marriage as there were many other factors and issues with compatibility involved, but the cost and subsequent debt contributed heavily to the failure of this marriage.

As an old-ish buck to a young one, you have nothing to prove to anybody. You don't need to have a big expensive wedding and never take on debt to have a wedding. Have a ceremony within your means and ensure your financial freedom. Learn from my mistakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/uuhpzl/weddings/,Weddings,,132,111,1.0

1cawy1i,Kenya,1713850829.0,"here are proven solutions if you think you are going to sleep hungry today.

You’re going to sleep hungry, remember. So, drop your ego, walk around and collect the following.

Metal (Chuma)

A kg of Chuma goes for Ksh 50. If you collect 5 kgs in a day, you have Ksh 250

Water/juice bottles

A Kg of water/juice bottles goes for Ksh20. These are the easiest to find because they’re everywhere. If you collect 10 kg per day, you have Ksh 200.

Plastic

A kg of plastic goes for Ksh 35.
If you collect 3kg per day, you have Ksh 105

Cartons

A piece of used carton (that has not been torn apart) goes for Ksh 5
If you can visit the retail shops in your neighborhood and ask for them, you can’t fail to get at least 20 pieces. 20 times 5 is Ksh 100. You can decide to stock them and sell them after a week. So, let’s say in a week you have 200 pieces. That’s Ksh 1000.

Beer cans (Tusker cans, whitecap cans, OJ cans, etc)

A kg of beer cans goes for Ksh 100 per Kg. If you visit the drink joints in your hood, you can collect 1 Kg in a day. That will be Ksh 100.

There are so many recycling plants in Nairobi and other cities and towns that you can sell these things. Just ask around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1cawy1i/usilale_njaa/,Usilale njaa,Discussion ,133,112,0.99
14k6jqk,Kenya,1687850413.0,"I have seen someone sharing their short stay experience in the US I have enjoyed reading through that thread, here is my experience of China (North) for 4yrs . I specify north because life/ culture/language/ weather is very different from the southern parts of china. If anyone has been to china even for a short stay lets hear your experience. 
Long post alert ! 

Edit : Years !

1. Efficiency in the transport sector is by far the most impressive part about China in my opinion.  Its so easy to get from point A to B having the options of a wide subway network, buses, cheap taxis(safe), bicycles trains and bullet trains. There are lanes for cyclists/motorcycles as well and they are cheap to buy if want yours. Bus/ train fares are so cheap. Mtu hajui kichinku ata struggle koz you have to know names of where you are going and to read maps . 

2  Safety.  In my 4 yr stay I have never lost anything to pick pockets nor  have  I ever seen one. We would ride bicycles 2 am in the night and enjoy the breeze during summer its so safe . Mahali umesahau kitu utaipata hapo the next day. Infact ukiibiwa kitu just know its your fellow kenyan that has taken it. Taxis are extremely safe. When it comes to any sort of crime sikuwai experience ama kuskia. 

3.Since I speak the language fluently, I experienced the hospitality and chinese culture in a deep way . I have never been mishandled by a chinese person even if I ask for directions they are very helpful and (most) of them take it as an honor to have foreign friends they want to take you out all the time , buy food and stuff for you.   Note that this is not the case everywhere some cities where africans are in big numbers or even less have chinese extremists or just ignorant and uninformed chinese that hate/ ostracize black people,In the city I stayed foreigners are few so wachinku huko welcome foreigners but if you cant speak the language definitely it will be hard to get by they will shy off attending to you even in shops. 

4. Kushikashikwa nywele na kuulizwa if our braids are real of fake hair. Long stairs by chinese people ata kwa subway unaangaliwa hadi mtu anakosa kushuka stage yake ndio tu akuone and they dont fear they make eye contact  . Wengine wanakataa kukaa na wewe kwa basi ndio wakuwe na angle ya kukucheki fiti. Ile inaudhi they take photos of you without asking and I mean literally every where. Alafu few think an african can read and understand their language wanakusengenya and I confront them when I hear something insulting/ racist. Most times I used to pretend siskii lugha ndio wasianze kuuliza the common questions to foreigners: which country are you from, how old are you, how many people are in your family, do you have a boyfriend, do you wash your hair daily, how many hours is the flight from your country to china etc. 

5. Cheap stuff everywhere electronics are cheap, clothes are cheap ( except in malls akina zara etc) , utilities and renting an apartment is cheap (except city centre) my 3 bedroom  ( kilimani chinese style  apartments) cost me ksh 21kes monthly so tulikuwa mastude tunashare 3 people kila mtu analipa 7k. We used to cost share on bills though stima was the most expensive during winter other than that hatukuteseka . Machakula tunabuy kwa soko they are cheap. Things online are cheap and delivery services are very efficient.  I literally survived on food delivery services esp during winter when u dont want to go out or cook. 

6. Its good to note that I was on scholarship so life was fairly easy for me as compared to self sponsored na watu wenye waku huko ku hussle . Chinese have a racist aspect where they don't think blacks know anything or can speak English.  Most jobs there go to whites and light skinned people.  I used to teach English as a side hussle but you have to prove yourself. My chinese language skills kinda helped me negotiate my way through but still huko they prefer whites for jobs. They are also obsessed with mzungu English accents. People lucky enough to work in international schools are reaping big. 


7. I enjoyed Church and the community there of foreigners those years church was not so restricted and regulated.  There were lots of activities to keep things interesting and fun.
For the sake of watu wa sherehe,  the nightlife in china is lit and I mean lit ! West africans are in large numbers huko and they know how to party most are employed in clubs as djs or mc/ hypemen etc. Wakenya mkikutana in one place mkiwa wengi (rarely in the city I was) it was always so much fun. 

8. Dating life . My fren thats another kanairo watu wanabadilishana watu huko like underwear. ( foreigners to foreigners) Especially in a small town where everyone knows everyone 

9. Chinese are pathetic , when it comes to hygiene.  Clothes are so cheap huko but mchinku atavaa nguo 1 month without changing. They have a habit of spitting kikohozi every where and they make that sound. They belch loudly and hardly take showers during winter. (The older men mostly). Also because of their diet midomo zao hunuka , their bodies also have terrible odours. Their bathrooms clog because of hair shedding. The population of old people there is alot . Families have one kid wao hushtuka nikiwaambia my family is comprised of 
6.

10. Last but not least all Google products are censored in China. You cant use fb, Instagram whatsapp etc without a vpn na sometimes vpn zinasumbua depending on the phone you have. Hakuna google maps unatumia maps ya huko . Search engines unatumia za huko but info is so limited since the government has censored outside world news and especially from the US. Even movies zikitokea if kuna inappropriate parts they cut them out hawana sex culture huko. Wale watu wakunyonga wanateseka since all blue content is completely censored ofcourse with the exception of a reliable vpn . Kama wewe ni mtu wa weed or hard drugs you will suffer since you wont find that stuff anywhere in china unless you are deep state. I never saw any of that huko lakini sigara ni kwa wingi na pombe na bei ni ya jioni.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/14k6jqk/4_yeas_in_china/,4 Yeas in China,Adventure ,132,56,0.99

1che576,Kenya,1714540821.0,"I made a very stupid mistake at the end of my first year that led to my discontinuation from a top uni in KE. I hadn't realised how privileged I was as a government sponsored student because as I was looking for another uni so that I transfer  I found out the self-sponsored pay a lot each semester. I could see my dreams get shattered before my eyes.

My mental health deteriorated because seeing my friends in school while I was at home was tough. Going office to office trying to get someone to listen to you proved futile. I had never been indisciplined all my life, this was a first and I was being punished hard. My parents supported me, emotionally and mentally, to get through it but I could tell they were a little disappointed. I even started drinking, a lot and using all kinds of drugs to try numb the pain but it wasn't helping.

I had to find something to do to keep myself busy. I enrolled in a free online bootcamp to pursue a SWE certification and gained some valuable skills.  This might have been the best decision.

I decided to appeal against my discontinuation. One would say I was emotionally attached to this university and couldn't move on. The financial situation at home also contributed. I appeared before the Appeals Committee which upheld my discontinuation. Two academic years had already passed at this point. I knew it was over as I read that letter in the Administration complex corridors. I sat on one of the benches and was deeply lost in thought when a faculty member passing told me I could RE-APPEAL. I didn't know that. He sat there with me for a while and gave me pieces of advice before going his way. Honestly, I didn't want to write it, because what was the point, but I did it anyway.

Fast forward, a year later I get a call from university to pick a letter. The committee that reviews re-appeals apparently does it in your absence. It had good news this time, my discontinuation has been lifted on humanitarian grounds. I guess I have the strange man in the corridors to thank for. I'm going back to school on September after 3 whole years out in the cold but the thought of starting all over scares the hell out of me. I feel like I have wasted a lot of time. Seeing my colleagues graduate adds salt to the injury. 

I would like anyone who might have had a similar experience to share theirs as it might go a long way in helping me keep my head in the game when I return to school.

After 15 months of playing a Master distiller in my crib (undisclosed location) thanks to covid lockdown I have managed to craft four types of alcoholic drinks courtesy of this powerful traditional plant called MURATINA harvested from the slopes of Kieni, Nyeri County 

introducing The Muratina Family, the finest traditional drink using today's science and technology 

1. **Muratina shine/vodka** x3 distilled 40% abv 
2. **Muratina Oak** 40% abv (rested in oak barrel for 8 weeks )
3. **Muratina original** 8% abv
4. The first Crafted **Muratina beer** made with Hops, Barley Malt, spring water, and Muratina herb 4.7% abv kegged and refrigerated to keep it fresh, crispy and chilled (my favorite)  

I will be launching Muratina Beer and Muratina original at my friend's wedding in August with an intent to go into full production the legit way

Throwaway because my main is accessible to friends and some family members. I am 34f married to 40m and I can say we’ve had an okay marriage, we married at 26 and 32 respectively. We have 2 children (boys) my pride and joy we both love them so much. 

Issues in our marriage started about 4 years ago where I discovered my husband had a girlfriend for about 2 years , how I didn’t figure that out is absolutely crazy to me because mimi na hubby have always been open with our phones as in kama I needed to order something,google something or call someone when my phone was off or not close by ningetumia yake. We’ve always been this happy couple , our friends envy us ,they always say how they want something like our relationship, I was proud and my parents were proud of my good choice of a man.

Siku moja my guys I was ordering from Glovo  on his phone and I went through it ( sijui mbona) call it instincts and I found a messaging app he’s never used to communicate with me. I should have just stayed away from it or ignored it kumbe my mans had another kababe on the side… talk about nudes , sexting, all that good stuff bro do you know the feeling where unaskia kiwaru is real! I had a huge lump in my throat he was out kwa shops at that time so he didn’t see me having all this crazy reactions. Ofcourse when he came back he found me crying , I was throwing myself of the floor ( embarrassing) asking if I wasn’t good enough for him. I went to my parents for a week  with the boys and he came to them to ask them to allow us to work it out , my parents , myself and him talked it out and I decided to go back home for the sake of my kids and the love and all the remorse he portrayed.

Everything was okay for a few months until I discovered AGAIN he never stopped, just became better at it. At this point I still wanted my boys to grow up with both parents the same way I did and truthfully I still loved my husband. I’m a beautiful woman, if I do say so myself but I only had eyes for my husband until I didn’t. My husband makes a little bit more than me but I can sustain both myself and kids if I wanted to. He is a great father I will never take that away from him.

Ever since I found out he is still sleeping around on me it’s like I stopped caring and started considering myself a single married woman, we still have sex but I always insist on wearing a condom I don’t know which whore he’s  been sleeping with, this has caused so may fights and I simply told him trust went down the drain years ago.

There’s a guy I have been seeing, (since he decided we were open by sleeping with other people)I feel like I’m 16 when I think of him, we met on one of my summits and he is literally the best sex I have ever had in my life , I didn’t even know this kind of intimacy existed. I think I love both him and my husband, but when it comes to sex , the new guy wins by faaaaaar.

My husband is starting to pay a little bit more attention to me now that I’m taking care of myself l’m wearing more make up and dressing sexier,  it’s not for him most times .

I’m enjoying this double life as a family woman and a sexually liberated woman. Maybe I feel what most men feel , security at home and a life of fun. I love it.  Are there married women who feel the same in this sub? Maybe we can have our little community anonymously or on WhatsApp!

1413erx,Kenya,1685942760.0,"I was a content writer for the last 2.5 years. Nonstop work. Suddenly Google won't penalize AI-generated content, clients vanished. I was writing articles almost every single day. It's how I survived covid. Now I'm down to 1 article per week if I'm lucky, and it's not funny. I never once used AI in my work, and I don't intend to. Writing original content is easier (and more fun) than fixing what a machine blurts out. 

I'd appreciate any leads for more writing or editing/proofreading work, doesn't have to be SEO. Yes, I'm applying to other platforms but they're taking their time. I'm guessing they can't hire writers if they can't find clients. 

TIA.

Edit: Mmekam through, thanks to all of you. The ideas so far:

- Niwache kichwa ngumu and use AI to my advantage
- Learn new skills and change with the times
- Create content for a profitable niche
- Check Fiverr for leads
- Try forex and crypto
- Tafuta sponsor (wasee kuweni serious sometimes)

I'll update as you continue to chanua me.

Edit 2: You guys have combed me niiiiicely. Asanteni. More things I've learned:

- Change is a weird thing. Kuna wenye wako in denial (kama mimi hehe), na wenye wamegive up, na wenye wanasonga nayo. I guess this is normal, ni mtu ajue kwenye ako. 

- Kuna wenye walikula pesa ya online jobs wakatuchomea picha. If you're over there saying, ""Waone sasa vile wanalia,"" please remember hatuko wote the same, in fact most likely hatujuani. Wenye wanajua vile hii job hukuanga ngumu tunajinyamazia tu. 

- This AI thing iko na terms and conditions. Kuna vile you must shikanisha different tools until they make sense. For me who knows only writing, AI is a complete upskilling process. 

- There's no kuomoka chap chap with the way things are going. If any of us try the advice here, tujipee time kabla mambo zipick at least tuone tushilingi.

I met this woman when the son was 1 year old and I developed such a close bond with the child because of being with the mother. I stepped into the role of a father to this child because I loved the lady and I could envision a future with her.  I had a good job and could provide for both of them comfortably. I was with her for about 4 years, until 2019 when the father to the son showed up and she did not hesitate to get back to the father of the kid. That is how I was dumped. In those 4 years of being together, she always insisted she was not ready for another child but was open to the idea of getting more children in future. When the relationship ended, I felt used. She was using me to raise the son and perhaps to keep her occupied as she waited to see if the baby daddy would change his mind and come around.   Dating women with children can be a thankless job.

Watu wa jaba stories this is not for you ..

I came as a Kemboi, nilipata makaratasi after a certain time, ilibidi nivalishe MTU sipendi Pete.

So, ukikuja in the name of chini ya maji, people will take advantage of you., My 1st job I was cleaning at a Kenyan truck company they were paying 800 bob an hour for 9hr, and second job 7hrs for 900 bob..224k monthly. Pesa kidogo Sana.

With your salary, you can't afford housing, most Kenyans are on 3 jobs ama mnaishi kama wa Nigeria, 8 people in a 2 bedroom. It's a struggle. You're also dodging immigration, we have cops that stop buses and check documents. Or they raid areas where mostly illegals live, pia Kenyans will sell you out.

Some of us a lucky tulipata paper work. I've met people who came in the 90s Hana hata karatasi moja.

Kemboi huku, wengi live on the streets.  Especially those who come and don't have relatives. Kuna MTU mahali hupata Tupesa anabahatika anapata agent, because ameambiwa majuu kuna jobs they come and end up homeless.. Ukiwa homeless you can't get any job. You have to get a sleeping sections.. mnaingia by 6 leave by 7. Huko they will steal even yo shoes.

Many many Kenyans and Nigerians are homelessness. Coming home ni shameful, ulienda majuu unarudi nil. Sometimes unapata host, ukifika Kwa ground they switch off their phones..so you need to have a solid line when you arrive.

Coming to US is not hard, survival is the problem.  

Bila papers you can't own anything. Most things uko nazo zitakuwa under someone else. Kikiumana , they can retain your things and it happens a lot. MTU amerudi Kenya unaskia alikuwa majuu na ni mlevu utapata alioshwa manyumba na magari, sasa Hana kitu.

If you can apply for a greencard. The process is easier and better, they cater for a lot of things , getting a job is better, you can do jobs za $20/70hr .

So don't fall for the pictures people post, ati anadrive rangerover.  That's among the cheapest cars huku used. You can get one na 200k, gari zingine hata 60k ziko safi.. and have custom plates with your name.  Streets are cleaner so hata ukipiga picha kwa slum it looks better than Kilimani. 

Before you come be ready for loneliness, Struggles that will beat you down like nobodies business, the cold is extreme, kama uko na shida za kifua, you will deport yourself.  Huku health care is expensive asf. You can spend 100k on simple things like a tonsil infection. Kama uko na shida shida za mwili reconsider coming..

14nlqb6,Kenya,1688186370.0,"So, after a while of singlehood  loneliness, I decided to join a dating app. Got this guy,we had great vibes, first meet was a walk which was alright.  Continued chatting on phone several days after the walk and we agreed I visit his place one Friday evening to smoke a joint together. Am not a smoker but it was out of curiosity to feel the high that people gush about.

So one good Friday evening nikajituma kwake, carrying a big bag of popcorns which he had said he likes(was taught by mom hufai kwenda Kwa wenyewe mikono tupu). The guy immediately informs me yeye alikua amenunua food na amekula yote so he hopes I have eaten too. Well, I had eaten like 2 hrs earlier. Anyway,sawa jamaa, let's smoke the weed basi, si hio ndio imenileta?

So we smoke the joint na ikanishika kwelikweli. Started feeling thirsty (atleast maji ilikua), hungry( minyoo zijipange) and quite disoriented. Well, sex was had(though I informed him that I didn't think I was in the right headspace for it). I don't know if it's the weed or what, but I felt like sex went for too long and unfortunately weed didn't make me horny. Man, I just wanted to sleep. Then asubuhi jamaa akanilambisha glucose, literally, like aliniekea kaglucose Kwa mkono nilambe🤣🤣🤣, then he sindikizad me kwa stage. 

Yes,you can call me easy for the lack of control for that night, but am already mad at myself. I didn't talk to the guy much after that, though he kept sending ""hi, how are you"" messages and generally trying to keep in contact. Then after some time he sends me a message that he wants to hang out. In my mind I was like....hang out? Like keep me hungry, f*ck me and unilambishe glucose?☠️☠️.... Ffs, just leave me alone.

18agwz4,Kenya,1701683477.0,"Why are we Kenyans so dishonest? Let me give you a back story. When I was in high school, I read an article about corruption in Kenya on Wikipedia. 

The article said that 3 out of every 5 Kenyans are corrupt, meaning they are actively looking for ways to steal money every day. 1 out of the remaining 2 isn't actively doing so, but in the event that the opportunity arises, anapita nayo. The remaining 1 is the only one that is honest. 

I remember being so furious at the writer of that article. According to me, it had racism painted all over it. Deep down I knew Kenyans were better than that.

This wasn't until I got into corporate after graduation. Yoh, we Kenyans are a corrupt lot. I saw people trying to make an extra 200, 500 out of every deal and situation. I saw managers compromising on the quality of work for an extra shilling. 

I have seen people employed in small shops and drivers stealing mercilessly from their employers. Someone just posted on this sub that their Mama Fua has been stealing small items from their house even after paying them really well. 

This really makes me sad and very disappointed in us. The article was right and it really pisses me off. Why are we like this? You want to tell me your dignity is worth Ksh. 200? Or a spoon?

And don't tell me the reason for our lack of morals is poverty because it's not. We have multi-millionaires and billionaires looting the hell out of this country and undercutting others. We steal so much and still keep going. Hii tabia mbaya tulitoa wapi? And why is it so deeply routed and normalized in our culture?

These idiots have created fake profiles of beautiful young women targeting the elders bana. Now, your work as a 'chat moderator' is to talk to these gukaas.

Then get rid of your African hair!

1) The pickpocketer, yani pinji/mtu wa kusanya, the guy in possession of your property will quickly go to your control panel & put your phone in Airplane-mode then he will shut down your IPhone Or Use Just Remove Your SIM card and throw it away .Wewe utastruggle hapo kucall simu yako lakini wapi...

2) Mr Pickpocketer/Mr Pinji/ Mr Msanyanji, will now do everything in his power to get as far away from the vicinity as possible, usually as far as the next County...

3) The following day, after sleeping off his Heist, Mr. Pickpocketer will quickly find a Brocker & sell them the  phone at a stupidly cheap price, usually at around 1000 - 5000 kshs. why? because stealing iphones is 1 thing but Overriding the ICLOUD LOCK is another, An Iphone with an ICLOUD LOCK is like carrying around an expensive brick. Very useless to Mr. Pickpocketer.

4) Now the phone is in the hands of  Mr. Brocker, These brockers are usually people who own stores that sell refurbished IPhones pale CBD or employees of such stores. Now Mr. Brocker, since he is a business man he needs to make back the 1000shs he spent on buying your IPhone from Mr. Pickpocketer right? He Has 2 options. 1) Sell the Parts of the IPhone abroad usually , price is roughly 50 - 100$. 2) Try & Get your Apple ID & Password in order to override The ICOLUD LOCK & then sell the IPhone at Retail price of 1300$ and make 100% profit.

5) Mr Broker will usually opt for option number 2, lazima wapate maximum returns just like any other business man. This is where the PHISHING EXPEDITION starts. 

6) Mr. Brocker will usually wait roughly 2 months before kicking off the PHISHING EXPEDITION. because at this time, unakuanga ushaa kubali simu imeenda hivo & most IPhone owners will put the phone in Lost Mode. Lost Mode is when you LOG into FindMyIphone in another device & put the lost phone in LOSTMODE which usually locks the phone further and displays a message on the screen saying 'This Iphone Is Lost Please Contact This number' 

7) Now step 1 of the Phishing Expedition involves Mr.Brocker going to a very remote area  where he will turn on the IPhone in order to see the LOSTMODE screen so that he can get your contact information. he will then switch the phone off and leave the remote area because the location of your Iphone will have been pinged on FINDMYIPHONE.

8) After he has gotten your contact info, ataenda kwa bedsitter yake pale Thika and that's when the number that you put in LOSTMODE will start receiving messages from 'Apple' claiming that your iphone 14 PRO MAX 512 GB GOLD has been located & you need to click this 'link' in order to view the location. Most Kenyans are gullible and they will click this link, the link will require you  to put in your Apple ID & Password & BOOM! that's how you loose your IPhone FOREVER.

9) Wewe ukiwa katika harakati za kuweka password yako in order to 'Locate' your Lost IPhone, Mr. Broker is on the same terminal on another device watching everything you're doing & after he gets your Apple ID & Password, he will reset your IPhone, take it to his shop & sell it as a new phone & make good money.

* You lack self-control
* Lack self-respect
* Have no commitment
* Have difficulty maintaining relationships
* High risk of contracting or spreading STI's

If you are a promiscuous man, you have no grounds to call a woman who is not a virgin or has a body count ""low value"", ""304"" or a ""h\*e"" when you are a worse reflection of her in a different gender. Also, demanding to pair up with a virgin when you spent years becoming a manhole, is hitting below the belt. Do better. Be better. Life has a way of giving second chances.

\*A man who has uncontrolled, unrestrained, s\*xual encounters with numerous women, in this case, can be termed a ""ran through"" person.

18p1tj3,Kenya,1703322351.0," One night I was out clubbing in Thika town. The group I was with comprised of two couples. The five of us ordered drinks. I wasn't happy about third wheeling with two couples, but I was having fun nonetheless. At around 11pm this girl hits me up and says she is also in town at another nearby club. She says she's bored and wants me to go pick her up so we can party together.  


Damn, everything was falling into place. I wasn't sure about the location, so I checked my Google maps, and the other club is literally a five-minute walk away. So, I sneaked out without even informing my friends because I was pretty sure I'll be back in a few. I got there; found her & we quickly left the place.  


As we were on our way back walking on the street, This man pops out of nowhere and grips my hand. My first thought was that this was a thug, so I stiffened up and my other arm was already in a fist ready to strike. In the blink of an eye this guy whips out some hand cuffs without saying a word. Before I knew it my left hand was handcuffed, and I'm confused at this point. What kind of BDSM shit is this. It turns out the guy is a cop in civilian attire and the other uniformed ones are just a few meters away.  


The two of us were pulled into a corner. I got to share handcuffs with this awesome dude. Within a span of 10 mins about 10 other unsuspecting people were rounded up in the same manner. One of the cops explains to us that we've been arrested because we're walking out in the streets of Thika town where it's not safe. Therefore, they found it prudent to take us under their care so we can spend the night at their Air BnB (Police station), and we'll be free to leave in the morning. He conveniently failed to mention that the state of art Air bnb costs about 2000 shillings per head.  


Perhaps I could have negotiated for a cheaper bribe on the spot to avoid spending the night in jail. But we played along and slept at the police station.  


How do we put an end to this exploitation?

Many guys jumped to the conclusion that she didn't like him. Personally, I can say there are many times I really liked a guy. However they got sexual too soon and I lost interest.

One time I really liked a guy. Then I heard him he say, 'What else is there in a relationship? Isn't it just sex?'. That's how some people bond. I had to start seeing him as a friend from then on. Discovered there was this girl who had this magical hold on him. It seems sex is all it took. There are people who find their soul mates like that. 

I understand some people are quick to be sexual, but others are not. It could be a difference in dating styles or flirting/culture. It shouldn't be that far-fetched to imagine someone may not have a similar style to yours.

v4k4dl,Kenya,1654329394.0,"Let me explain. Global loneliness rates among young people us going up. This is especially true for men, who have a harder time than women forming communities. Locally, Covid made things worse and the economy makes things worser. Bc now we can go out and engage in fun activities and partake in hobbies but we don't have the money.So we stay in, buy bundles and watch movies, maybe log into whatsapp once in a while.

Now,one can realistically have multiple friends but only one girlfriend  (for the most part). So, it doesn't make sense that every woman they meet they instantly hit on? Statistically, does it not make sense to offer friendship up first, and if it organically blossoms into something romantic, good for you, and if it doesn't, you still have a friend in your repertoire?

Because you could hit on someone and if they are not interested you have lost yourself a  potential friend and maybe future partner both in one fell swoop.

Maybe I'm just frustrated because in one week, one man started sending intimate texts within 3 days of meeting, another solicited sex within an hour of inviting himself over and making poor one sided conversation and yet another made a good conversation awkward with innuendos when we both know I've seen his SO bring him food multiple times.

There's something expensive we lose, especially in today's world, when you sheer bonds prematurely by introducing sexual/romantic subtext. Bc now, though we share interests, i no longer feel comfortable in these men's presence and they won't meet my eyes in the corridors any longer. And for what?

That 30 minute sex you think you want with an essential stranger won't fill the void. I know it, idk how y'all don't. And, as per multiple studies, sex is better with someone you know too, so y'all aren't even being devious enough to play the long game smh.

He professed first. We do go out for drinks every now and then but free to have serious relationships. I asked for this because it's just proper that he sets to have that in his life. I'm much more inclined towards guys older than my age or closer to my age for serious relationships. But he is a good vibe, he makes good conversations and a hardworker. He's not taken advantage of me sexually or financially.  We all just get to do this together with our heads on our shoulders...mostly just sorting our dryspells. 

So, back to Diani, ooh I got hurt. We resided in a homestay, that has other clients in it. There's a pool, so Diani being Diani, the heat just let's one go to the pool. So, our first night, he goes to a the pool, with the whiskey we had. He whiles his time there for maybe 2 hrs... I'm in the house, arranging things and getting dinner ready. That's Thursday night. On Friday, some friends of mine invite us out to Manyatta, a club,  for drinks. But before I join them, I go to this bachelorate party till around 11.00 p.m then my pal picks me. 

On arriving at Manyatta, he's already drinking with the boys, but he also tells me that our neighbours at the homestay are there. I dismiss this as just kawaida thing. But, he goes out and comes with one of the ladies... and asks that she sits with us. I tell him, its upto the other guys, so I can't just invite her to our table. (Maybe some jealous streak came out). 
He goes ahead and escorts her back to their table. I text him... what's the meaning of this? Do you want their company more than mine?. He comes to me with story that oooh, the ladies thought our table is lit, so they want in. I ignore this, but now I'm kidogo pissed plus a little drunk. I then tell him, he can choose where he wants to spend time at. He's free to do so, but he should know he is my companion on this trip. So he sulks hapo, and I think they are talking with this girl. I leave the table at the terrace and go inside. My friend follows me, asks what's up... I tell him nimeboeka na hapo nje. This 'my companion' texts ati can they join me inside, and guess what he brings, this chick. 

So coz nimejam, I tell him after this drink, I'm headed back to the room. He says his drink is still a lot he'll finish it then we go. But, they are whispering amongst themselves, they are dancing together, nini nini... basically flirting tu mbele yangu. I leave after a while, my friend drops me and he goes back. That's around 2.00 a.m now. I've endured like 2hrs of them doing this. I don't text, I don't call... I sleep.Do you know this guy comes back at 5.00 a.m on Saturday. So najijazia he  was with the girl and who knows, they might have gotten intimate. Coz he came in, went to the bathroom and washed his boxers... I make a mental note to ask him about this before we head to the wedding. He says they just talked and danced but ati mimi ndiye I pushed him to do that. Huh!😳, and yet he knew we were invited for althis drinks and he was excited about it. So I figure, he probably chatted this girl the previous day at the pool... and the time I was at the bachelorate party, they might have gone to Manyatta together. 

Let me tell you, niliboeka yangu yote. I pushed through the wedding, with a heavy heart. He sensed this and kept to himself. We did have the wedding after party, but he didn't want to hang around much, he asked that we go back. We did... kumbe he wants to go party with them girls back at the residence. Mimi nilimwachilia to the world... I didn't ask anything but I avoided even his touch. I couldn't bring myself to talking to him... I'd just Netflix with my beer in the room. I was too mad to even go anywhere. So, the last 3 days i probably spoke 10 words to him. To imaginei had to endure the trip back with him... he'd parked at my house, so we came all the way together. He had the guts to say we'd talk sometime, as he left... but I'm planning not to. I am cutting him off, coz I feel that was disrespect and intentional. 

Am I just over reacting or its justified to feel bad/wronged with all this? I know we aren't exclusive but I played my part as his companion, I expected the same. Plus, if it was him getting girls, shuwally, not just in my face like that! 

What says you guys... I'd like to hear your thoughts.

15wedoe,Kenya,1692545355.0,"My sister has been married for around 7 years. She called me a few days ago that her husband left her with no explanation. I know the guy and his circle of friends. I did some digging to find the cause of him living his family (two kids). Turns out, he lost his well-paying job during COVID lockdown and was freelancing and contracting for survival. He never got back to the levels he used to though. My sister is a writer and she's been making more than him. Earlier this year, he wanted to be the manager of her funds as well but my sister refused to let him. Nonetheless, whenever he needed money, he would always take it from her and she had no qualms. My sister told me that she was even taking the whole family out with her money from time to time.
Turns out, this was the cause of breakup. The guy felt that my siz has been disrespectful to him and nonsubmissive. When I asked his friends an example of the disrespectful behavior from my sister, he laughed and told me that my sister has been taking up his responsibilities like taking the family out and such. Then he went ahead and explained the state of mind of the guy and why he viewed all that as disrespectful.
Well, I totally understand and somehow agree, but leaving your family is another thing. He should have tried to tell her how he felt and not give up on hustling.

Was having this conversation yesternight with some friends and a 50 year old jamaa. And we came to one conclusion. We do not have a 3rd place. Our parents generation and before had work, home and a 3rd place they attend to for pleasure, fun, to unwind, to decompress and vent whatever expectations the other two places had on them. 

It dawned on me why pops had a clique of male friends of the bottle and mum had those Chama girls. Why grand dad went to play ajua atleast once a week at the rural market. Why my grand uncle had an exclusive hat in the village where he only had access to. Why they had a farm somewhere far from home to go to, though evidently it was super loss making or mildly profitable.

Then there's us, our de facto 3rd place is social media, tv or the noisy clubs on Friday. And they do more harm to our psyche. Overly stimulating with none engaging dopamine hits. It's even worse for the work from home folks and introverted people. The closest comfort for a 3rd place is the gym and that is even being eroded now.

Was on a bus to Nairobi and a guy opened the window the whole way. I could see everybody was uncomfortable with the cold but no one said a thing. People wore extra clothes. He like opened it the whole way and wind was literally coming into our bus. 

Another time while waiting for ID, a lady was there vomiting profusely and was very sick. Nobody even spoke to her. She had to take herself to the hospital alone. 

Another time while opening an account at equity, the bank teller kept shouting at us. We were like 25 adults. Nobody said a thing. And we didn't do anything. For hours while waiting.

Some other time an Asian guy was insulting us at Naivas supermarket in broken English while waiting on line. Nobody said a thing. Even the watchmen. He apparently didn't want anyone close to him.

Here are simple steps that any driver can follow and end up saving fuel by 85%.

-Before you start your engine, make sure you check on your engine oil and coolant levels.

-Start your car engine let it run for atleast 30 seconds to allow oil to circulate.

-As it runs check on the tyre pressure and make sure they are good.

-After the 30 seconds switch off  your car engine.

-Lock the doors, and walk to work.

And the sas part is that I don't remember his face(poor face recognition memory) if he did that in a public place na place haina watu , he is a potential rapist and I can't do anything about it, I don't know how many girls have experienced this out there and even worse, it seems something small but it really isn't, he got away with it sijui nani mwingine will go through that and my heart goes out to those who have been through worse, i am sorry anything like that happened to you.

I have been so heartbroken by a lady i loved with all my heart. We were at a very advanced stage and i remember saving hard to buy for her a tanzanite engagement ring.

It has been a slow decline ,they typical withdrawal , communicating with her was becoming difficult , she was very rude and very cold.

I thought it was the normal stress of being unemployed , so i took time and really invested in her getting a job. Did more than 50 job applications online . I even started a business that struggled to standard up.

She dropped a bomb on me 3 days ago to forget about her and that she is getting married in a months time.

I was totally blindsided. Nilisimama so that i don't faint from the news. My whole body trembled.

It has been a tough mental time for me. I cannot sleep , i am in tears and very vivid images in my mind of her having sex with another man is eating me alive.

For once i considered self deleting. The mental anguish is crazy. I fear i might run mad.

She was laughing when breaking the news to me. It was a demon was talking . 

There was a disgust she had in her voice for me.

So apparently doctors refused to attend to her because she hadn't gone to any antenatal care before that (idk why, please don't ask). They had to bribe a certain hospital to admit her but unfortunately it was too late and both mum and child passed away in the process of all the running back and forth. I didn't know docs could withhold treatment from someone clearly in dire need of help because of something like that. I don't know how pg or antenatal care work, but I will be looking into that before having a baby.

Last year my ex came to me and borrowed $1000, (102,000ksh)  for flight top up and some document processing. She had gotten a Canadian visa. I gladly helped because we had a good rapport with the parents. I had no reservations.

The agreement was she would pay after 4 months,  everything legit, no bush beating shit. 

On the 8th month, I reached out to this las, meen the entitlement, she flatout refused to payback. And said it was pay for sex. And time together. And thought she'd gotten away with it. I called the dad, he to was an ass hole within an asshole.

14jlwl8,Kenya,1687796808.0,"In the spirit of posting topics other than politics, s*x and relationships, wacha I share my experiences so far in the US. I am visiting friends and relatives in Ohio and Georgia. 

1. Everything is big over here, I now understand why obesity is such a big problem. For every family I have visited, there is a humongous fridge full of food. Plus big cups and big bowls and plates. Na fridge za US si kama za Kenya, ni kubwa. Na bado unaona watu wakipika.

2. Decided to attend a Kenyan local community church as I thought since they are here they would hold more diverse views. Welp, regretted it immediately and reminded me why I left church in the first place, Christians can be the most bigoted and intolerant people out there. And they were fundraising to build a church in some slums, felt like telling then Kenyan slums have the most churches and it's probably a scam. 


3. Everyone seems shocked when I tell them I am going back to Kenya. With the exception of GC holders and students, it seems majority of Kenyans came here as visitors and just never went back. So they get surprised when they see a visitor who is not planning to stay. But the love for the motherland is real, most Kenyans seems are here to hustle and plan to go home at some point. 


4. US kuna watu wazee kabisa, wazee yaani 90s and 110 years olds. Had a chance to visit an adult home care and honestly it was extremely depressing to see those tumzees living their sunset years hapo. No family to visit them, wako tu hapo. Makes me really appreciate the togetherness we have as Kenyans and we love and support our cucu's and gukas


5. Mass consumption is ingrained here, people buy, buy, buy, buy stuff all the times. So people's houses are full of stuff. The variety also makes it easier for people to buy buy buy. American marketing it seems is the best in the world,these guys have mastered the art of subliminal marketing. Offers, sales, BOGOFs, etc can make you go broke very easily.

Over the past 4 months i've been working on building a small tool to track my previous KPLC electricity transactions. Felt that the current self service portal really wasn't sufficient to do the same.   
So i built [stima.app](https://stima.app) that does a subjectively better job in showing giving you more info on your prepaid / postpaid transactions.  
For more on the how the core part of the platform works check out [this blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/b1ba269b-8b37-4203-b85a-e917ae47a495)  
The app is free forever and was built as a hobby educational project with no intended commercial use in plan. Only Subscription data (name ,email , meterNo) optionally provided by the user is stored for the purpose of sending a monthly roundup email. All queries made to get past transactions are not cached in a database. You can check out more on how it was built in a recent [blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/0a3dee5b-de91-49a8-84c4-7f2cb0faca6c).

If keeping track of your past bills resonates with you, then give stima app a try :)

xeknp5,Kenya,1663208968.0,"Hi guys. My neighbour's maid knocked at my door yesterday so hard I thought the building was burning.
She asked me if we have a smart tv to which I replied no. She ran away only to come back a few minutes later. She asked me to help her with their tv. 

I went there reluctantly because her boss is a very rude and mean woman. She wasn't there. She gave me the remote and asked me to delete the tv search history on YouTube. I was curious to know why. 

I was shocked to find that she had searched:

Sexy sexy,  
Phonography,. 
Man and woman sexy sexy,. 
Indian sexy sexy. 

I think she was trying to search for porn and I felt extremely awkward. She tried to explain to me that the children sometimes search for ""bad things"" .

I told her that the children are too young to do that. She said that sometimes the tv acts up and she doesn't know how it happened. Anyway I tried and after sometime I delete all the search history. 

Then she told me she had a problem with her neon ray. I could tell it was new. She asked me to ""wipe everything"" on the phone. I said ok and wanted to reset the phone. After confirming if she knew the email and password, she brought a paper where the information was written. I figured that maybe she wanted to delete her search history on chrome and YouTube. 

I was curious and looked at what she had searched and saw the same theme. She was trying to look for xxx videos without success. The farthest she has ever gone is those clickbait romantic videos on YouTube. Like how bad can someone be at looking up porn on the internet. They are literally billions of such videos 😂😂😂.

Anyway I cleared her search history on YouTube and chrome and gave her back the phone. She took some time looking at the phone. I am assuming she was looking at the history and after a minute I saw her smiling. She asked me how I was able to get her contacts back if I wiped everything on the phone. I bragged that I know such staff.

I didn't reset the phone because with neon rays you can only use the email registered after the phone was bought. Also the email password she gave me was incorrect. I couldn't go into recovering the password at that moment. 

Anyway I feel bad for her. I have a lot of porn in my phone. Should I just ask to send her some. She could lose her job if her employer sees the search history on YouTube in the tv.
